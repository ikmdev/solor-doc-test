        <title>What is LOINC®?</title>
        <para>Bodenreider et al. provide an overview of LOINC®: </para>
        <para><emphasis>Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC®) is a clinical
                terminology for identifying health measurements, observations, and documents. LOINC®
                was initiated in 1994 by the Regenstrief Institute, a non-profit medical research
                organization associated with Indiana University. By 1994, many electronic systems
                were sending clinical information as discrete results using messaging standards such
                as Health Level Seven (HL7) or ASTM 1238 (American Society for Testing and
                Materials). Inside these messages, laboratories and clinical systems used local,
                idiosyncratic names and codes to identify which test was being reported. This
                practice was problematic for data exchange and aggregation because of the large
                resources it takes to map codes between every participating
            system.</emphasis></para>
        <para><emphasis>To solve this problem, Regenstrief organized the LOINC® Committee to develop
                a common terminology for laboratory and clinical observations. Existing
                terminologies were not granular enough, focused on coding for billing rather than
                clinical results delivery, or did not fit with the messaging models being used.
                Because such a standard did not exist, the LOINC® Committee embarked on creating a
                terminology with [an] appropriate level of granularity for defining the names of
                observations used in laboratory and clinical information systems. Since its
                creation, LOINC® has continued to be developed and published by the Regenstrief
                Institute as a freely available global standard with a set of implementation tools.
                Today, LOINC® is used by a diverse global community that propels its continuous
                development.</emphasis></para>
        <para><emphasis>LOINC's® primary role is to provide identifiers and names for observations.
                Here, observation [is used] as a generic term for health data represented in a
                particular way. In different domains, these might be called tests, variables, or
                data elements. Within and among health IT systems, observations are communicated
                with a structure that has two key structural elements. The first element identifies
                what the observation is, e.g., diastolic blood pressure, hematocrit, tobacco smoking
                status. The second element carries the result value of the observation, e.g., 80
                (mmHg), 40 (%), or “current everyday smoker”. When used together, these two elements
                carry the instance of a specific test result for a given patient. A common pairing
                is to use LOINC® as the standard code for the observation, and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms® (SNOMED CT®) as the
                standard code for the observation value, when needed. This approach is endorsed by
                the developers of both terminologies and fits their design
            purpose.</emphasis></para>
        <para><emphasis>Some mistakenly believe that LOINC® is only for laboratory tests. It is true
                that the first release of LOINC® in May 1995 contained only terms for laboratory
                testing, but by December of 1996, LOINC® had already added about 1,500 clinical
                measurement terms (vital signs, ECG measures, etc). Now, more than 20 years and 60
                releases later, LOINC® has grown significantly in other domains, including
                radiology, standardized survey instruments and patient-reported outcomes measures,
                clinical documents, nursing management data, and nursing assessments. The LOINC®
                Committee itself is now composed of three major composite committees: Laboratory,
                Clinical, and Radiology. </emphasis>[1]</para>

            <title>LOINC® Current State</title>
            <para>Regenstrief continues to update LOINC® and publish twice-yearly releases. New
                concepts are added to LOINC® based on submissions from end users. The current
                version contains more than 99,000 terms covering the full scope of laboratory
                testing (chemistry, microbiology, molecular pathology, …etc.) and a broad range of
                clinical measurements (e.g., vital signs, ECG, patient-reported outcomes, …etc.). In
                addition to distributing the terminology, Regenstrief makes available at no cost a
                variety of supporting tools and resources, including the Regenstrief LOINC® Mapping
                Assistant (RELMA®) and online search application.</para>
            <para>LOINC® uses a semantic data model containing six major and up to four minor
                attributes to create fully-specified names for concepts. The major attributes of the
                LOINC® name are:</para>
            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Component (e.g., what is measured, evaluated, or observed)</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>Kind of property (e.g., mass, substance, catalytic activity)</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Time aspect (e.g., 24-hour collection)</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>System type (e.g., context or specimen type within which the observation
                        was made)</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Type of scale (e.g., ordinal, nominal, narrative)</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Type of method (e.g., procedure used to make the measurement or
                        observation).</para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
            <para>The atomic elements that make up each LOINC® term name are called “Parts” and are
                also assigned identifiers. The combination of attribute values produce term names
                that are [intended to be] detailed enough to distinguish among similar observations.
                Of the six attributes, only the method is optional and used only when necessary to
                distinguish among clinical important differences. </para>
            <para>“A fully specified test result or clinical observation can be described formally
                with the following syntax: &lt;Analyte/component>:&lt;kind of property of
                observation or measurement>:&lt;time aspect>:&lt;system
                (sample)>:&lt;scale>:-&lt;method>.” [2]</para>
            <para>Over time, LOINC® has not only grown in size, but also developed additional data
                structures and content around its main codes for individual observations. The LOINC®
                release contains a basic hierarchy that organizes LOINC® codes into a set of is-a
                relationships. LOINC® now has a detailed model for representing enumerated
                collections of observations, such as laboratory panels (complete blood count),
                assessment instruments (e.g., PHQ-9), data sets (National Trauma Data Standard), and
                forms (e.g., U.S. Standard Birth Certificate). This content is published in a
                special release artifact called the LOINC® Database, with the current version
                (August 2022) containing more than 99,000 terms. LOINC® also has a detailed model
                for connecting observation terms to structured answer lists. These answer lists can
                be defined by extension or intension and linked to observation terms with different
                types (e.g., example, preferred, normative). This content is published in the LOINC®
                Answer List File, with the current version (August 2022) containing links between
                25,640 unique LOINC® terms and 4,341 unique answer lists composed of coded LOINC®
                Answers, and including mappings to other terminologies such as SNOMED CT® where they
                exist. LOINC® now also publishes the atomic elements (called Parts) that make up
                each LOINC® term name. The LOINC® Part File includes the Part identifiers and names,
                links between Parts and LOINC® terms, and mappings from LOINC® Parts to other
                terminologies such as SNOMED CT® and RxNorm where they exist.</para>

                current state. </para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">Regenstrief is committed to working with developers of
                    health data standards that are complementary to LOINC®, including syntax
                    standards for data exchange and other terminology standards. Regenstrief and HL7
                    have a long-standing collaboration; a few joint work highlights include clinical
                    genomics guides, claims attachments specifications, and approaches for
                    representing vocabulary standards in Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources
                    (FHIR) terminology services. Regenstrief Institute made core LOINC® content
                    available via a FHIR API as part of its normal release process beginning Summer
                    2018.</emphasis></para>
            <para>In April 2022, a LOINC® Terminology Service using the FHIR Standard was launched
                with an API that provides a means for users to access LOINC® content across multiple

            <para><emphasis role="italic">Regenstrief and the Institute of Electrical and
                    Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standards Association, developer of the 11073™
                    standards, are collaborating to enhance the interoperability of traditional
                    medical devices and personal health devices. Regenstrief is an active member of
                    the Health Standards Collaborative (HSC) which provides an executive forum for
                    senior leadership of the U.S. healthcare standards development community to
                    improve interoperability. In 2017, Regenstrief worked with the In Vitro
                    Diagnostic (IVD) Industry Connectivity Consortium (IICC) on a specification for
                    publishing vendor IVD tests associated with a set of LOINC® codes that identify
                    the distinct observations produced by the test.</emphasis></para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">In the context of the specifications of the U.S.
                    Meaningful Use incentive program, LOINC® is the primary choice for specifying
                    attributes, and SNOMED CT® the system of use for the relevant attribute values.
                    In other words, LOINC® is used to specify the question (e.g., 29308-4: “what is
                    the diagnosis?”), and SNOMED CT® to specify the answer (e.g., 3723001:
                    “Arthritis”). Adoption of this principle by both the Regenstrief Institute and
                    SNOMED International has formed the basis for the cooperation agreement. In
                    2013, Regenstrief and SNOMED International formed a long-term collaborative
                    relationship to link the rich clinical semantics of SNOMED CT® to LOINC®, which
                    provides extensive coverage of laboratory tests and clinical measurements.
                </emphasis>[1]</para>
            <para>While the initial partnership and memorandum of understanding signed between
                SNOMED CT® and LOINC® developers paved the way
                for development teams to facilitate interoperability and minimize duplication of
                effort, the collaborative relationship did not accomplish a complete integration of
                the two disparate terminologies. Further integration has been proposed to leverage
                SNOMED CT®’s model for the representation of LOINC® building blocks and for a more
                consistent representation of clinical and laboratory observations in SNOMED CT®.
                Furthermore, the use of description logics for the representation of LOINC® was not
                accomplished under this initial partnership in 2013 and only SNOMED CT® currently
                uses this formalism. LOINC® still uses its distinct formalisms and tools for its
                representation, has its own release cycles and versioning mechanisms, which makes
                seamless integration with SNOMED CT® non trivial, if possible at all. </para>

        <title>What is SNOMED CT®?</title>
        <para>Bodenreider et al. provide an overview of SNOMED International: </para>
        <para><emphasis role="italic">Since the inception of the Systematized Nomenclature of
                Pathology (SNOP) in 1965, the various versions of
                <?oxy_comment_start author="naylee" timestamp="20231130T112715-0600" comment="This should be SNOMED as we&apos;re referring to the initial organization back in 1965 before SNOMED International was declared"?>SNOMED<?oxy_comment_end?>
                have developed both in terms of content and underlying representation. Development
                of content is clearly illustrated by the number of elements in the various systems.
                SNOP comprised “about 15,000 distinct medical objects, processes, and concepts”. It
                developed further into SNOMED-2, and later SNOMED International, which contained
                150,000 concepts in the mid-1990s. Its successor, SNOMED Reference Terminology
                (SNOMED RT), contained over 120,000 active concepts. The initial version of SNOMED
                CT®, the merger of SNOMED RT® and the UK-based Clinical Terms Version 3, released
                January 2002, consisted of 278,000 active concepts, a number that has grown to
                350,000+ in the January 2022 release of SNOMED CT®. The representation has gone
                through phases of increasing formal rigor. The initial SNOP and SNOMED versions were
                multi-axial systems that enabled post-coordination. Whereas SNOP started as a 4-axis
                system, SNOMED International had expanded to using 12 axes: anatomy (topography),
                morphology (pathologic structure), normal and abnormal functions, symptoms and signs
                of disease, chemicals, drugs, enzymes and other body proteins, living organisms,
                physical agents, spatial relationships, occupations, social contexts,
                diseases/diagnoses and procedures. SNOMED RT® abandoned the use of self-standing
                axes that could be combined into composite codes in favor of a description logic
                formalism called Ontylog, based on the Knowledge Representation System Specification
                (KRSS) syntax and the K-REP system. Following contemporary naming conventions for

            <title>SNOMED CT® Current State</title>
            <para>Regarding the current state, Bodenreider, et al., go on to say:</para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">Since the first release of SNOMED CT® in January 2003,
                    updated versions have been released twice a year. Maintenance can lead to a
                    decrease of the number of elements, e.g., in January 2010 when, among others,
                    the veterinary content was removed from the International Release.
                </emphasis>[1]</para>
            <para>The July 2022 release contains 356,817 active concepts, 1,202,379 active
                relationships and 1,286,456 active descriptions. The largest categories of concepts
                in SNOMED CT® are disorders (23%), procedures (16%), body structures (11%), clinical
                findings other than disorders (10%), and organisms (9%). In SNOMED CT® parlance,
                descriptions are labels that describe the concepts, not textual definitions of the
                concept, of which SNOMED CT® contains 9762. </para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">A significant design criterion for SNOMED CT® is to keep
                    concept expressions simple enough to be broadly usable by clinicians, while
                    maintaining faithful representation of concept meaning. Validity of concept
                    expressions is determined by adherence to the concept model underlying SNOMED
                    CT®. This concept model specifies which types of relationship are allowed for
                    which concepts, and what the allowed values are. For example, the concept model
                    specifies that “Method” is an allowed attribute relationship for “Procedure”
                    concepts, for which the value should be a type of “Action”. The January 2018
                    release uses 82 relationship types, almost twice the number of the initial 42
                    relationship types. Since July 2017, the concept model is available in
                    machine-readable form, and distributed as separate tables which are part of the
                    semi-annual releases. Other tables provide mappings to several versions of the
                    International Classification of Diseases (ICD9-CM, ICD-10 and ICD-O). The
                    current release format, called Release Format 2 (RF2), supports versioning,
                    providing access to any previous release of SNOMED CT®.</emphasis></para>
            <para>While SNOMED CT® has made much progress in their use of description logics, and
                have also provided a tool on github, snomed-owl-toolkit, to facilitate the
                conversion and classification process, the official distribution of OWL refsets has
                yet to be seen. It seems one reason is the lack of current clinical systems to
                utilize them at this time. [3-4]</para>

            <para>Here’s an excerpt of what Bodreider et al. have to say about Collaboration
                Initiatives:</para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">SNOMED CT® is not developing in isolation, but
                    increasingly collaborating and harmonizing with other relevant standards in the
                    area of structured and standardized storage and exchange of biomedical data.
                    This includes mapping, as well as binding of information model and terminology.
                    Mappings are maintained between SNOMED CT® and a number of terminology systems.

                    versions ICD-10 and ICD-O of the International Classification of Diseases), as
                    well as the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC-2), the
                    International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP), and LOINC®. The latter
                    is especially important in the context of the specifications of the U.S.
                    Meaningful Use incentive program, in which LOINC® is the primary choice for
                    specifying attributes, and SNOMED CT® the system of use for the relevant
                    attribute values. In other words, LOINC® is used to specify the question (e.g.,
                    29308-4: “what is the diagnosis?”), and SNOMED CT® to specify the answer (e.g.,
                    3723001: “Arthritis”). Adoption of this principle by both the Regenstrief
                    Institute and SNOMED International has formed the basis for a cooperation
                    agreement in 2013.</emphasis></para>

        <title>What is RxNorm?</title>
        <para>Here’s an excerpt of Bodenreider et al. overview of RxNorm:</para>
        <para><emphasis role="italic">At the dawn of the twenty-first century, there was no standard
                terminology for drugs in the U.S.. While many companies provide information about
                drugs for use in clinical information systems (e.g., to support clinical decision),
                each drug knowledge base defines its own codes and names for medications, making it
                difficult to exchange information across clinical information systems and to
                retrieve information from different systems. For example, the same transdermal patch
                delivering 0.583 milligrams of nicotine per hour for 24 hours (e.g., to help with
                smoking cessation) is referred to with the following codes and names in three of the
                major drug knowledge bases: • 2707 nicotine 14 mg/24 hr transdermal film, extended
                release • 102712 Nicotine 14 MG/24 HR Transdermal Patch, Extended Release • 016426
                NICOTINE 14 mg/24 hour T R A N S D E R M P A T C H , TRANSDERMAL 24 HOURS In
                addition to capitalization differences, there is a lack of standardization in naming
                dose forms (transdermal film vs. transdermal patch) and units (24 hr vs. 24 hour),
                making it difficult to parse names from multiple systems. RxNorm was created to
                address the lack of standardization in drug names, and to make drug terminologies
                interoperable by integrating them into a reference system. Since the 1990s, the
                National Library of Medicine (NLM) has released the Unified Medical Language System
                (UMLS), a terminology integration system in which names and codes from all major
                biomedical terminologies are integrated, and equivalent terms across vocabularies
                are identified. RxNorm can be thought of as a specialized version of the UMLS. While
                both UMLS and RxNorm are built upon existing vocabularies, one major difference
                between the two is that UMLS generally does not create names for biomedical
                entities. In contrast, RxNorm creates a “normal form” for every drug entity it
                integrates. In RxNorm parlance, normal forms are standardized terms for drug
                entities. For example, the normal form for the nicotine patch discussed above is “24
                HR Nicotine 0.583 MG/HR Transdermal System”, to which RxNorm permanently assigns the
                concept unique identifier 198029. Unlike the UMLS, RxNorm also defines a rich
                network of named relationships among the various types of drug entities it
                integrates (e.g., ingredient, brand name, generic drug product, branded drug
                product). The main use cases RxNorm was designed to support include electronic
                prescribing, drug information exchange, and mapping across drug vocabularies (e.g.,
                for medication reconciliation purposes). Standard names and codes for drugs were
                also expected to facilitate the development of standard clinical decision support
                rules involving medications. RxNorm started in 2002. It was first released through
                the UMLS and has been published as an independent terminology with monthly releases
                since November 2004, and weekly updates since 2008 to reflect drugs recently
                marketed in the U.S. market. The number of sources integrated in RxNorm has grown
                from 5 to 13.</emphasis>[1]</para>

            <title>RxNorm Current State</title>
            <para>Bodenreider et al. go on to talk about the current state:</para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">Sources. RxNorm currently integrates terminology
                    information from most drug knowledge base vendors (e.g., First DataBank, Multum,
                    Micromedex, Gold Standard), as well as the drug component of standard
                    terminologies (e.g., SNOMED CT®, MeSH). RxNorm also integrates sources from

                    public entities<?oxy_comment_end?>.More recently, RxNorm has also integrated
                    international drug resources, such as the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)
                    Classification System and DrugBank, a drug resource used in many research
                    projects. </emphasis></para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">Organization. The RxNorm drug model distinguishes between
                    generic and branded drug entities and identifies three major definitional
                    elements for drug products, namely ingredient, strength, and dose form, along
                    with two additional elements, quantity factor and qualitative distinction. The
                    major types of drug entities include ingredient (e.g., Azithromycin), brand name
                    (e.g., Zithromax), clinical drug (e.g., Azithromycin 250 MG Oral Tablet), and
                    branded drug (e.g., Zithromax 250 MG Oral Tablet). Generic and branded packs are
                    collections of clinical and branded drugs, respectively (e.g., Z-PAK, a branded
                    pack of 6 tablets of 250 milligrams of azithromycin). While drugs are sold
                    mostly pre-packaged in some countries (e.g., individual tablets in blister
                    packs), packs are available for a minority of drugs in the U.S. In addition to
                    the six major drug entities, RxNorm provides entities for navigational purposes.
                    Clinical and branded drug components associate ingredient (or brand name) and
                    strength information, and clinical and branded dose forms associate ingredient
                    (or brand name) and dose form information.</emphasis></para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">The various types of drug entities in RxNorm are organized
                    into a graph that can be easily traversed, enabling users to navigate among
                    types of entities (e.g., to find the branded drugs associated with a given
                    ingredient). While its main organization principles have remained centered on
                    the ingredient-strength-dose form triad, RxNorm has added definitional features
                    to accommodate distinctions, such as duration for extended release forms and
                    transdermal systems (e.g., the quantity factor “24 HR” in “24 HR Nicotine 0.583
                    MG/HR Transdermal System”) and size of unit of presentation for injectable
                    medications (e.g., the quantity factor “40 ML” in “40 ML Ciprofloxacin 10 MG/ML
                    Injection”), as well as qualitative elements for specific drugs (e.g., the
                    qualitative distinction “Sugar-Free” in “Sugar-Free Cholestyramine Resin 4000 MG
                    Powder for Oral Suspension”). A drug product in RxNorm is fully defined by its
                    set of ingredient, strength, dose form, quantity factor, and qualitative
                    distinction values. Types of ingredients include multi-ingredients (e.g.,
                    Sulfamethoxazole / Trimethoprim) and “precise ingredients” (e.g., Atorvastatin
                    calcium, Morphine Sulfate), generally denoting, salts, esters, and complexes of
                    base substances. As illustrated in the examples above, RxNorm normal forms
                    reflect the definitional features of drug entities. Additionally, RxNorm
                    explicitly links drug entities to these features, which supports efficient
                    processing. For example, the generic nicotine patch “24 HR Nicotine 0.583 MG/HR
                    Transdermal System” is linked to its ingredient (Nicotine), strength (0.583
                    MG/HR), dose form (Transdermal System), and quantity factor (“24 HR”).

            <para><emphasis role="italic">The scope of RxNorm is different from that of drug
                    knowledge bases. RxNorm focuses on drug names and codes. In other words,
                    clinical information (e.g., indications, drug classes, and drug-drug
                    interactions) and administrative information (e.g., drug pricing) are out of
                    scope for RxNorm. Although it integrates international sources (e.g., ATC,
                    DrugBank), RxNorm focuses on drug products marketed in the U.S. Finally,
                    non-therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, bulk powders, contrast media, food,
                    dietary supplements, and medical devices, such as bandages and crutches, are all

                    by the National Council for Prescription Drug Program (NCPDP). Similarly, the
                    development of RxNav and the RxNorm API have greatly benefited from the feedback
                    provided by their user community. For the past five years, NLM has held an
                    annual DailyMed/RxNorm Jamboree Workshop to bring together the RxNorm
                    stakeholders. To extend the usefulness of RxNorm despite its limited scope, NLM
                    has also initiated partnerships with providers of clinical information that can
                    be linked to RxNorm. For example, NLM has developed companion APIs to link
                    RxNorm drugs to various drug classification systems and to publicly available
                    sources of drug-drug interaction information. Drug classes for RxNorm drugs can

            <title>Knowledge Representation and Description Logic</title>
            <para>A report in the 2016 Yearbook of Medical Informatics defines terminology as “a
                system of concepts with assigned identifiers and human language terms, typically
                involving some kind of semantic hierarchy. Some systems may support the assignment
                of multiple terms, or synonyms, to a given concept; these may include terms in
                multiple natural languages, such as English or Dutch.” [10] This definition implies
                that knowledge representation for a terminology system may not always be based on a
                strict defining hierarchy. The advantage, or disadvantage, of such an approach is
                that the terminology, such as LOINC® for instance, might appear to be rather
                intuitive and human-readable and comprehensible. However, when delving into complex
                use cases, a lack of formal defining structure may reveal that it is difficult to
                understand the precise meaning of the terminological representations and that use of
                a system such as LOINC® may differ widely amongst humans. Further exacerbating
                potential variability is the heterogeneous behavior of tools implemented to reason
                with terminological structures. [11] </para>
            <para>The field of Knowledge Representation and “Description Logics” was developed out
                of the attempt to formally define “intuitive representations” with a formal
                semantics to establish a common ground for human and tool interoperability.
                Knowledge representation involves the design of formalisms for expressing knowledge
                about a particular domain and focuses on representing and characterizing classes of
                objects and relationships between them. </para>
            <para>An ideal state terminology that relies on description logics may invoke more
                formal semantic relationships between and among concepts. Use of a Description
                Logics reasoner can help in overcoming important drawbacks of multi-axial systems
                and other non-standard, distinct formalisms: (1) the capability of detecting
                semantic equivalence of syntactically different expressions, and (2) the automated
                classification of concepts in a hierarchy. </para>

            <para>Bodenreider et al. provide an overview of SNOMED Design Criteria:</para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">The representation of SNOMED has gone through phases of
                    increasing formal rigor. The initial SNOP and SNOMED versions were multi-axial
                    systems that enabled post-coordination. Whereas SNOP started as a 4-axis system,
                    SNOMED International had expanded to using 12 axes. SNOMED RT® abandoned the use
                    of self-standing axes that could be combined into composite codes in favor of a
                    description logic formalism called Ontylog, based on the Knowledge
                    Representation System Specification (KRSS) syntax and the K-REP system.
                    Following contemporary naming conventions for description logics, the set of
                    constructors used corresponds to the EL ++ language. SNOMED CT® has continued to
                    use this description logic as its underlying representation.</emphasis></para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">A significant design criterion for SNOMED is to keep
                    concept expressions simple enough to be broadly usable by clinicians, while
                    maintaining faithful representation of concept meaning. Validity of concept
                    expressions is determined by adherence to the concept model underlying SNOMED
                    CT®. This concept model specifies which types of relationship are allowed for
                    which concepts, and what the allowed values are. For example, the concept model
                    specifies that “Method” is an allowed attribute relationship for “Procedure”
                    concepts, for which the value should be a type of “Action”. The January 2018
                    release uses 82 relationship types, almost twice the number of the initial 42
                    relationship types. Since July 2017, the concept model is available in
                    machine-readable form, and distributed as separate tables which are part of the
                    semi-annual releases. Other tables provide mappings to several versions of the
                    International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10 and ICD-O). The
                    current release format, called Release Format 2 (RF2), supports versioning,
                    providing access to any previous release of SNOMED CT®.</emphasis> [1]</para>
            <para>While SNOMED CT® has committed to an application of formal methods and rigor to
                its knowledge representation, others have explicitly rejected the value of
                description logic and chose not to provide a defining taxonomy or fully define
                LOINC® parts.</para>

        <title>Comparing LOINC®, SNOMED CT® and RxNorm to Cimino’s Desiderata</title>
        <para>Despite the guiding principles for terminology design and representation summarized
            above, “LOINC® does not fulfill the definition of a computable medical terminology as
            articulated by Cimino et al., that being one based in concept orientation, concept
            definition, and polyhierarchy. These characteristics enable the logical inference
            between concepts, parts, and part elements.” [12] LOINC® is a well-maintained
            terminology – there is a deprecation process and has concept permanence where codes
            aren’t reused – but they do not establish the basic parameters of hierarchy and
            polyhierarchy. And, they are violating the tenants of Cimino’s Desiderata.</para>

            <para>SNOMED CT® is the terminology of our current awareness most closely aligns with
                the Desiderata. As stated elsewhere, it uses Description Logics for computability
                and facilitates the use of reasoners to determine equivalence among various
                syntactic representations. The primary downsides are 1). Some proprietary concepts
                and 2). Lengthy concept submissions process for consideration into either the
                National or International editions. This lack of agility, efficiency and speed is
                apparent in crisis situations such as COVID-19 pandemic. Otherwise, it has proven to
                be robust and has a large global community to assist with its development and
                vetting.</para>

            <title>Comparison of RxNorm to Cimino’s Desiderata</title>
            <para>While RxNorm meets most of the Desiderata’s requirements, there are a few that are
                not met. Of particular importance is the lack of Description Logics. Use of a
                Description Logics reasoner can help in overcoming important drawbacks of
                multi-axial systems: (1) the capability of detecting semantic equivalence of
                syntactically different expressions, and (2) the automated classification of
                concepts in a hierarchy. RxNorm has another issue of not being a global standard as
                its development and main use is in the U.S. where it is a nationally recognized
                standard, i.e. Meaningful Use. </para>
            <para>However, recent work by Bona et al. have been developing a Drug Ontology product
                (DrOn), based on RxNorm and Chemical Entities of Biological Interest Ontology, which
                is a modular and extensible ontology of drug products, their ingredients and
                biological activity to enable comparative effectiveness and allow researchers to
                query National Drug Codes (NDCs) in multiple ways. Bone et al. go on to say the
                following:</para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">We have implemented a full accounting of national drug
                    codes and RxNorm unique concept identifiers as information content entities, and
                    of the processes involved in managing their creation and changes. This includes
                    an OWL file that implements and defines the classes necessary to model these
                    entities. A separate file contains an instance-level prototype in OWL that
                    demonstrates the feasibility of this approach to representing NDCs and the
                    Concept Unique Identifiers (RxCUIs) and the processes of managing them by
                    retrieving and representing several individual NDCs, both active and inactive,
                    and the RxCUIs to which they are connected. We also demonstrate how historic
                    information about these identifiers in DrOn can be easily retrieved using a
                    simple SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL).</emphasis>[13]</para>
            <para>This development may have a significant impact on improving knowledge management
                as well as the ability to utilize Description Logics reasoners with its attendant
                benefits.</para>

                    building on SNOMED CT®'s foundation. Nonetheless, SNOMED CT®'s commitment to
                    develop and expand their use of description logics formalism as called out by
                    Tinkar efforts as well as their alignment with the Desiderata as described by

                <para>While SNOMED CT® has a process for handling new concept requests and
                    submissions, it is lengthy and not amenable to rapidly changing conditions as
                    seen with COVID-19. While workarounds can be done, what is needed is a formal,
                    standardized, and agile process to accommodate quickly changing
                    conditions/situations. The ability to share and aggregate data nationally, if
                    not internationally, is paramount.</para>

                <title>Compositional Complexity </title>
                <para>While SNOMED CT® uses explicit, elaborate axioms to clarify meaning, its
                    complex representation (compositional grammar) limits its broad adoption. [15]
                    The learning curve to appropriately learn, author, and represent concepts using
                    SNOMED CT®'s compositional grammar (for post-coordinated expressions) and
                    constraint language is steep, resulting in few who want to spend the resources
                    to learn. In addition, even for those who learn it, it takes substantial
                    experience to develop the expertise to understand and demonstrate concept
                    redundancy in a consistent and correct manner.</para>

                <para>There are multiple ways to represent SNOMED CT® concepts, leading to
                    inconsistent representation (i.e., lack of equivalence), ambiguity, and patient
                    harm from low data quality. SNOMED CT® is still up for constant refinement
                    especially for improving and standardizing concept representation, which makes
                    it difficult for the user to determine equivalence, both within and across
                    terminologies.</para>

                <title>Interpretive Comments</title>
                <para>Interpretive comments are meant to enrich measurement results. One specific
                    example is a statement of measurement uncertainty, which is required by some
                    metrological guidelines. Measurement uncertainty is invaluable in the correct
                    interpretation of measurement results. [15] Because interpretive comments can be
                    of crucial importance in patient care, it is critical to expand SNOMED CT® to
                    thoroughly capture these concepts.</para>

                <title>Inconsistent Selection of Codes for the Same Test</title>
                <para>Without concepts of polyhierarchy, concept orientation, and concept
                    definition, there is additional pressure on technicians and other stakeholders
                    to correctly specify the correct LOINC® code: “When the terminology model is
                    ultimately weak, it forces more onto the [statement] model”. [15] “A challenge
                    that remains to be solved is the binding of statement model and terminology.
                    There is often no clear demarcation between what is represented in the statement
                    model and what is represented in the terminology.” [9] </para>
                <para>Consequently, laboratory technicians may select a LOINC® code with an
                    incorrect part (i.e., the incorrect specimen or analyte) due to LOINC®’s
                    multiaxial hierarchy, resulting in difficulties for data aggregation and
                    understanding across both different technicians and institution. [12] It has
                    been reported that choosing different ‘properties’ (i.e., parts) was the most
                    frequent reason that different coding choices were made. [16] In a “study about
                    correctness of LOINC® mapping, choosing different ‘Method’, ‘Scale’ and
                    ‘Property’ attributes was the most common reason for different coding choices
                    among three large institutions. For example, in the ‘Method’ axis, some
                    institutions usually use a code that specifies the method (when available),
                    whereas other institutions always choose terms that are “methodless”. Another
                    example, is that in the ‘Scale/Property’ axes, LOINC® uses two distinct styles
                    (Prid:Nar VS. Prid:Nom) for reporting the interpretation of laboratory tests
                    (e.g. CFTR gene mutation analysis). The Narrative (Nar) scale is for free text
                    results (sentences, paragraphs, sections), whereas the Nominal (Nom) scale is
                    used for representing coded values, as when selecting an organism found on
                    culture from a coded list of bacteria. The differences between these types are
                    often subtle and require understanding the reporting system. Steindel et al.
                    also concluded that for some purposes, such as finding any code that could be
                    used to indicate the presence of a particular disease, rolling up LOINC® codes
                    and ignoring some LOINC® axes (e.g. method, scale, or property) can be
                    beneficial.” [16]</para>
                <para>There is not much management in terms of education in what codes are used for,
                    and medical technicians often do not have the LOINC® level of knowledge for
                    encoding that is necessarily expected. [17] The results in the following example
                    offer insight into how different codes may be selected for the same test from
                    different laboratories. </para>

                <para>Depending on the lab, technicians may choose different LOINC® codes for the
                    same test. The College of American Pathologists (CAP) surveyed 90 lab
                    participants on “practice setting, instrument(s) and test method(s), and LOINC®
                    code selection and usage in the laboratory and electronic health records” for 10
                    commonly ordered tests. 19.6% of codes reported were incorrect, with the highest
                    error rates “observed in the property (27 of 275, 9.8%), system (27 of 275,
                    9.8%), and component (22 of 275, 8.0%) LOINC® axes. Errors in LOINC® code
                    selection included selection of the incorrect component (e.g., activated
                    clotting time instead of activated partial thromboplastin time); selection of
                    panels that can never be used to obtain an individual analyte (e.g., prothrombin
                    time panel instead of international normalized ratio); and selection of an
                    incorrect specimen type.” </para>

                            <para>System – Between the different labs, some codes selected had the
                                system as control blood (Bld^Control), platelet-poor plasma (PPP),
                                or whole blood (Bld).</para>

                    </itemizedlist></para>
                <para>For a Prothrombin Time (PT) test, labs reported three different LOINC® codes
                    that could be selected. Results differed due to some labs incorrectly selecting
                    panels or the wrong system. For a D-Dimer test, results differed to differences
                    in component, property, system, and method.</para>
                <para>As referenced in the table "Correspondence of SNOMED CT® to Ciminos
                    Desiderata", many of the errors occurred from different selections in system,
                    where the system could be whole blood or platelet form plasma. “For the
                    analyzers used by the laboratories in this survey, coagulation tests such as
                    APTT and International Normalized Ratio (INR) are performed on PPP and are never
                    performed on whole blood, so the selection of a code that indicates the system
                    as PPP would more accurately represent the test performed as opposed to a code
                    that lists the system as blood (Bld). Superficially, an end-user may think that
                    “Bld” is a nonspecific answer for a collected blood specimen. However, LOINC®
                    has defined the system part term Bld as whole blood as indicated in section 2.5
                    of the LOINC® User's Guide V2.65.”</para>
                <para>LOINC® is an international standard which means that there are terms that only
                    apply to foreign assays but are still available for use by laboratories in the
                    U.S. This results in concepts such as “Whole Blood” that mean something
                    different than intended. End-users commonly use this concept when they intend to
                    represent “platelet form plasma”; this results in highly prevalent errors in
                    CoAg testing because the LOINC® concept for “Whole Blood” is perceived to be a
                    general term when it is not. [15]</para>

                    “inconsistency across institutions regarding specificity of mappings as they
                    relate to methods. It appears that sometimes mappers link the method specific
                    codes to a more general LOINC® code, and at other times they link to a method
                    specific LOINC® code. This causes inconsistency in mappings across

                        and SNOMED CT®. In January 2017, the project published a set of SNOMED CT®
                        formatted expressions that define the meaning of ~13000 laboratory LOINC®
                        observables employing the harmonized concept model. An expanded technology
                        preview of ~20,000 concepts has been released by the IHTSDO but is not
                        included in this publication. UNMC has converted the earlier expression set
                        into SNOMED CT® formatted extension concepts employing LOINC® long names as

                <para>Current quality control of LOINC® is limited or not known. While the
                    aforementioned Quality Assurance study proved that use of Description Logic is
                    promising and beneficial for terminologies such as LOINC®, these types of
                    quality assurance methods are not widely used. </para>

                <para>Regenstrief relies on an occasional survey (either once per year or once every

                <para>LOINC® is user-driven, so all submissions are coming from the community. This

            <title>Future Harmonization of Standards</title>
            <para>In the U.S., SNOMED CT® and RxNorm are harmonized but LOINC® has not joined the
                harmonization. There have been some partnerships and independently funded programs
                to help make LOINC® more compatible and useful within the ecosystem of controlled
                medical terminologies that converge on a model of meaning that can be shared.
                Further integration has been proposed but will require additional resources to bring
                these terminologies closer together. However, the collaboration between SNOMED CT®
                and LOINC® has been renewed. Create a LOINC® extension of SNOMED CT® to leverage the
                strengths of both has been the popular notion. This notion has been particularly
                attractive for the SNOMED CT®'s polyhierarchal structure and inferencing
                capabilities. This concept leads to embrace a greater compatibility and
                interoperability, integration of SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and RxNorm, while noting
                different formalisms and tools for their representation in these technologies. [26]
                Various terminologies have different semantics, models, release cycles, and
                versioning mechanisms. [1] While there is recognition that terminologies are not
                standardized at the exchange level, there is no consensus about harmonized next
                steps to solve the challenges.</para>

        <title>Terminology Knowledge Example</title>
        <para>In this section, we will be discussing a use case using questionnaires and
            responses.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Terminology Knowledge Problem Statement</title>
            <para>As a real-world use case, we focused on improving the diagnosis of emerging acute
                chronic infectious diseases, initially focusing on Long COVID as an example. There
                are numerous areas within clinical workflows for COVID-19 exposure and Long COVID
                diagnosis that are open to improvements that will ultimately help provide safe and
                effective patient care. There is a need to determine clear prioritization principles
                around focus areas for data capture within these COVID-19 workflows. To date, Long
                COVID has been primarily a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that it is often only
                diagnosed after all other conditions are eliminated as a possible cause of symptoms.
                Clinicians need to make quick decisions based on objective and subjective
                observations to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with Long
                COVID and whether the patient should be admitted to the hospital. Clinicians are
                encouraged to leverage technology, virtual visits, and other Health Information
                Technology (IT)-generated clinical data to assist with decision making and
                information sharing. Unfortunately, electronic clinical data is plagued by data
                quality challenges, including variation in how data elements are encoded by
                terminology standards, and stored in clinical information models. These challenges
                can cause inefficiencies in how clinical data elements are identified, retrieved,
                analyzed, and operationalized into workflows at the point-of-care. </para>
            <para>In the current workflows for COVID-19 and Long COVID, clinicians are encouraged to
                rely on electronic clinical data to determine which patients should be prioritized
                for being tested, hospitalized, and/or isolated. Failure to include or exclude
                patients’ screening, testing, and treatment could lead to life-threatening
                situations for patients and could impact the overall trajectory of the outbreak at a
                population-level. Overall, the ability to measure and improve healthcare outcomes
                relies on consistent, high-quality electronic data that is aggregated from a variety
                of Health IT systems across numerous medical centers and healthcare facilities.
                Clinicians need to be able to easily access and fully trust the electronic data they
                are using to make determinations at the point-of-care, key components of High
                Reliability Organizations and Learning Health Systems. </para>
            <para>Using ANF as a standardized statement model to streamline analysis could
                potentially lead to improved and earlier Long COVID diagnoses. This body of work
                aims to focus on workflow areas of data as it is captured for Long COVID – perhaps
                iPad data entry, EHR collection of signs and symptoms, emergency warning signs,
                patient-reported data, etc. – to understand how the collection of data elements in a
                consistent and high-quality manner, and the subsequent data analysis, fit into the
                overall goal of achieving coordinated, national and highly-reliable care.</para>

                    Diseases, specifically focused on Data Capture Elements and Long COVID Value
                    Sets</emphasis>. In support of Task 3.2.1, our team documented a generalized
                workflow and use case schematic for a patient’s journey from COVID-19 exposure to
                Long COVID diagnosis. We focused on decision points related to data capture of signs
                and symptoms related to COVID-19 and outlined key terminology and clinical
                information modeling considerations within the workflow artifacts that were
                developed. </para>
            <para>The team then gathered and reviewed value sets from the National Institute of
                Health’s (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM) Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)
                to identify common concepts and data elements that would need to be captured to
                support a Long COVID diagnosis. Each team member was assigned a value set and
                identified common and well documented concepts from their respective set, including
                signs and symptoms, laboratory tests, laboratory test results, potential and
                confirmed exposure, and suspected and confirmed infection. The concepts were
                organized by value set and documented in a table.</para>
            <para><emphasis>Aim 2: Draft Potential Questionnaires to Standardize Use Case Data
                    Acquisition</emphasis>. Long COVID is a poorly understood condition where
                patients experience COVID-19 symptoms long past the expected symptomatic period and
                whose symptoms, test results, and timelines can vary drastically between patients.
                The team developed sample questionnaires based on the VSAC value sets to collect
                additional data that patients or providers could enter into a Clinical Input Form or
                questionnaire. Traditional, current-state questionnaires were developed for the Long
                COVID use case to demonstrate how users may struggle to identify the optimal
                selections to document certain symptoms and may result in inconsistent and/or
                duplicative clinical data. The team then worked to develop an improved questionnaire
                that removes redundant and vague concepts and forces more granular and detailed
                selections to highlight ways to enhance the quality, accuracy, and interoperability
                of collected data.</para>
            <para><emphasis>Aim 3: Outline Variability in Statement Representations</emphasis>.
                Current terminology standards vary in the way they represent and code many data
                points that can be acquired through patient questionnaires. Critical information
                regarding severity, site, associated concepts, and data elements can be spread
                across the respective fields, incorporated directly into the concept code, or a
                combination of the two. The table aims to highlight the need for a normalized way to
                represent concepts to prevent loss of critical data and meaning as it is transformed
                and transmitted within and between systems. Improving the data collection, encoding,
                and storage of both present and absent concepts is essential in the effort to
                achieve lossless and interoperable data.</para>
            <para><emphasis>Aim 4: Demonstrate ANF Ability to Standardize Terminology and Capture
                    Critical Data</emphasis>. This paper ultimately aims to improve the acquisition,
                storage, and use of data across a variety of clinical situations, with the Long
                COVID use case as an example. We propose ANF as the tool to standardize and
                normalize the way critical data concepts from patient questionnaires are represented
                before transmitting to other systems for secondary use. The same concepts that were
                shown to have varying representations across terminology standards were modeled
                using a tabular ANF representation to demonstrate how ANF captures the same or more
                detail as other standards and normalizes the formatting of equivalent concepts
                across terminologies. The ANF table captures key data elements for the concept of
                loss of sense of smell since onset of COVID-19 symptoms. The concept ID, author, and
                topic are clearly documented along with timing of onset and recording. Not only is
                the concept itself represented in a normalized way that captures all pertinent
                values and details, but other normalized concepts, like linking to the beginning of
                symptom onset can be linked as associated clinical statements that add additional
                value and context.</para>

                    Acquisition</emphasis>. An initial questionnaire was developed for the
                generalized concepts extracted from the COVID-19 VSAC value sets that poses a simple
                yes or no question for each of the concepts that could potentially aid in a Long
                COVID diagnosis. This chapter focuses on potential questionnaires for ‘Signs and
                Symptoms’ and ‘Non-Specific Respiratory Diagnoses’, outlined in <xref
                    linkend="HypotheticalSignsandSymptomsQuestionnaires"/> and <xref
                    linkend="HypotheticalNonSpecificRespiratoryDiagnosesQuestionnaire"/>
                respectively. [2]</para>

            <para>While the initial version of the questionnaire on the left can collect important
                information and data, the format was improved in the version on the right to reduce
                redundancy, improve clarity, and collect more accurate and granular detail. The
                improved questionnaire forces patients or physicians completing the survey to select
                more granular symptoms and reduces ambiguity. Rather than allowing for individuals
                to select ‘cough’ and ‘dry cough’ or ‘productive cough’, the improved questionnaire
                forces a more accurate selection of either ‘dry cough’ or ‘productive cough’ to
                reduce redundant data. Additionally, the improved questionnaire utilizes
                user-friendly definitions like rapid breathing rather than highly technical
                terminology like ‘tachypnea’ to reduce duplicative symptoms and support accurate
                data collection from a wider audience. The value sets and questionnaires will need
                to be updated as symptoms are more comprehensively understood, and as new symptoms
                are identified. </para>
            <para>The team developed additional questionnaires for non-specific respiratory
                diagnoses below in <xref linkend="HypotheticalNonSpecificRespiratoryDiagnosesQuestionnaire"/>. The diagnoses questionnaires continue to improve data
                quality by reducing duplicative selections and improving granularity by forcing an
                Upper or Lower ‘Viral Respiratory Tract Infection’ rather than allowing the
                selection of both Upper or Lower Viral Respiratory Tract Infection and “Viral
                Respiratory Tract Infection’. These additional questionnaires demonstrate how
                improvements can be made to data collection across a variety of areas associated
                with patient care and can be applied to other emerging acute and chronic infectious
                diseases.</para>

                Building upon the concepts found in the VSAC value sets, the team developed tabular
                representations of certain symptoms to display the variability in the way concepts
                could be represented and coded. <xref linkend="HypotheticalNonSpecificRespiratoryDiagnosesQuestionnaire"/> depicts the symptom of ‘Fever Greater Than
                100.4 Fahrenheit with Chills’ across three example terminology standards as well as
                the null value of a normal body temperature. After reviewing the table, one could
                conclude that the first three examples are semantically the same. Each describe a
                condition of fever greater than 100.4 Fahrenheit, but critical information is spread
                out across the severity, site, and code fields depending on how the respective
                terminology standard represents the condition. This variability leads to sub-optimal
                data capture that can hinder data querying, data use, and the ability to identify
                semantically equivalent concepts.</para>

            <para><emphasis>Aim 4: Demonstrate ANF Ability to Standardize Terminology and Capture
                    Critical Data</emphasis>. The team demonstrated the value of ANF by developing a
                tabular ANF representation for loss of sense of smell since onset of COVID-19
                symptoms. ANF provides a singular, normalized way to represent concepts from
                different terminology standards by restricting various data elements to certain
                fields, like the severity of a particular symptom in the results section.
                Standardizing how data elements are reported facilitates the identification of
                equivalent terminology and improves the quality and interoperability of data. In the
                example below, ANF captures all the pertinent information including the symptom
                itself, option for the severity or numerical value of an observation, and the method
                of the observation, as well as additional information like the timeframe when a
                symptom first occurred. This additional information is an associated term that adds
                value and context to a measurement. </para>
            <para>While documenting symptoms that are marked as present on the improved
                questionnaire in a normalized format is essential, it is also important to represent
                signs and symptoms that are absent in a patient. Corresponding present and absent
                concepts for a certain symptom do not always exist across terminology standards, but
                ANF is able to represent the absence of a symptom using a numerical countable
                quantity, ensuring relevant and pertinent information is not lost.</para>

            <title>Recommendations to Address Terminology Issues</title>
            <para>This section aims to highlight some of the current shortcomings with the way data
                is collected and represented. We propose the following recommendations for data
                collection via patient questionnaires to reduce duplicative and vague data
                collection, facilitate secondary data usage, and improve data
                interoperability:</para>

                    <para>Restrict data entry and collection with pre-populated patient
                        questionnaires based on established concepts from the appropriate value sets
                        to standardize data collection. This will work when questionnaire designers
                        and data consumers know the data that they are trying to capture. In the
                        context of a condition where the signs and symptoms are less well defined,
                        or have not yet been defined, this methodology may inhibit knowledge
                        discovery and should be supported by integrated knowledge management
                        constructs that facilitate data agility and regular updates to value sets.

            <para>While standardizing data collection methods is a critical step towards data
                interoperability and ANF data transformations, there are still common sources of
                errors associated with normalizing clinical data. Errors normalizing terminology
                content, terminology semantics, and poorly defined interactions between the input
                and presentation of clinical data are three key problems that still need to be
                addressed. Several transformation languages and architectures exist for expressing
                and executing transformation logic to address the issues above and to normalize
                specific instances of clinical data into ANF. Users can choose a language that is
                best tailored for the format of the data source, while transformation quality and
                accuracy is left to the transformation author. Below is a list of four
                transformation languages and the associated benefits and limitations. While each
                option has its own limitations and cost, the ability to address or minimize common
                normalization errors justifies their use.
