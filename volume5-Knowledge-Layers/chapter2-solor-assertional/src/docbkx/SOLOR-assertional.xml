     <title>Assertional Knowledge</title>
    <section>
        <title>Introduction to Assertional Knowledge</title>
        <para>Previously, we discussed terminology knowledge, which does not represent how concepts
            influence or relate to each other in a clinical setting. This type of information is
            represented by assertional knowledge. For example, shortness of breath may be caused by
            myocardial infarction. Assertional knowledge represents facts related to a domain of
            study and is used to provide nuance and context to a concept, but does not define it.
            For example, Aspirin is used to treat pain, but it can also be used to treat fevers,
            prevent blood clots, reduce the risk of stroke and heart attack and many other things.
            The two major goals of including assertional knowledge are to enhance usability and
            improve documentation quality when using a terminology. Additional facts about clinical
            concepts can also be provided to support reasoning for automated quality monitoring and
            clinical decision support. [1]</para>
        <para>Additionally, assertional knowledge supports interface implementation by providing
            increased synonymy that is specific as to the context in which it should be used. What
            has been previously called interface terminology can be defined as a "systematic
            collection of clinically oriented phrases (terms) whose purpose is to support
            clinicians' entry of patient information into computer programs, such as clinical note
            capture and decision support tools". [1]</para>
        <para>This interface support is used to accomplish one of two tasks:</para>
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Encoding clinical narrative into a structured form, or</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Reviewing structured clinical information that has previously been encoded
                    using a different terminology. </para>
            </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>This interface support must enable correct and rapid interaction between clinicians
            and structured clinical data, support ease of use by healthcare providers through easy
            understandability, and integrate well with other clinical computerized systems in the
            environment. [1]</para>
        <para>Assertional knowledge is key to supporting interface implementation of the terminology
            layer. Assertional knowledge can support interface implementations of terminology
            by:</para>

        <title>Adding Clinical Modifiers to Concepts</title>
        <para>There are one of two general approaches to representing knowledge domains by clinical
            terminology.</para>
        <para>In one approach, developers <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="underline"
                    >precoordinate</emphasis></emphasis> (or enumerate) all possible complex
            concepts <emphasis>a priori </emphasis>and essentially create a list of all the complex
            concepts that can be expressed. A strength of this approach is increasing the chances a
            user will find a desired concept. Disadvantages include making a terminology so large
            that search becomes burdensome, and reduced flexibility in situations where the
            terminology does not contain concepts that a user may need. </para>
        <para>An alternative is <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="underline"
                    >postcoordination</emphasis></emphasis> in which users compose complex concepts
            by assembling general concepts and modifiers as needed. An advantage is increased
            flexibility for representing a wide range of concepts. Disadvantages include increased
            variation and inconsistent application of terminologies against clinical data, increased
            ability to create nonsensical complex concepts from modifiers and concepts, and
            inefficiency since postcoordination processes can be time-consuming. </para>
        <para>Bringing these two approaches together can optimize a terminology's flexibility, ease
            of use, and overall coverage. "Compositional balance" makes concept selection tasks
            efficient by reducing the effort to assemble complex concepts from general concepts, and
            reducing the time needed to search through long lists of precoordinated concepts. </para>
        <para>Prior to 2012, SNOMED CT® included qualifying relationships that could be used for
            creating a user interface that would post-coordinate concepts using pre-approved
            attribute value pairs. With the introduction of the RF2, qualifying relationships were
            no longer released in favor of the Machine Readable Concept Model (MRCM). The MRCM is a
            more comprehensive and flexible format for representing relationships and values that
            can be used to refine concepts.</para>

            <title>Representation of Concept Hierarchies </title>
            <para>Ideally, a terminology is represented in a way to promote easy use for automated
                data storage, management, and analysis. Description logics can formally model and
                specify the relationships that exist among concepts and modifiers and provide a
                structured representation of the knowledge domain.

            <para>The goal of interface terminologies is to optimize the user experience. Increasing
                efficiency and clarity of data review are key considerations for helping clinicians
                access, read, and understand encoded clinical data. A simple approach is to use
                relatively colloquial terms and display common phrases and words. More complex
                approaches include "auto-complete" features - when a user selects a concept (e.g.,
                "chest pain") and modifiers (e.g., "anterior", "dull" "present"), the system may
                leverage tagged terminologies to generate the natural language sentence (e.g.,
                "anterior dull chest pain is present"). </para>

        <section>
            <title>Clarifying synonymy</title>
            <para>Assertional knowledge relationships can be used to clarify whether synonyms are
                accurate representations of the same concept. For example, thorax pain and chest
                pain could be defined in a similar way, but thorax pain may imply to a healthcare
                provider that the pain is in the chest wall rather than internally as the term chest
                pain may imply.</para>

        <section>
            <title>Completeness of Synonym Coverage</title>
            <para>An adequate representation of synonyms in a terminology can increase the
                terminology's usability. Terminologies should represent the richness present in
                colloquial phrases of medical discourse and represent the variety of different types
                of synonyms that exist: </para>
            <para><emphasis role="underline"><emphasis role="bold">Alternate
                    Terms</emphasis></emphasis>: "Myocardial Infarction" for "Heart Attack"</para>
            <para><emphasis role="underline"><emphasis role="bold">Acronyms</emphasis>:</emphasis>
                "MI" for "Myocardial Infarction"</para>
            <para><emphasis role="underline"><emphasis role="bold">Definitional
                    phrases</emphasis>:</emphasis> "Ischemic injury" for "necrosis of heart muscle
                cells resulting from absent or diminished blood flow in a coronary artery"</para>
            <para><emphasis role="underline"><emphasis role="bold">Eponyms</emphasis>:</emphasis>
                "Levine sign" for "a clenched fist held over the chest indicating ischemic cardiac
                chest pain"</para>
            <para>However, rich synonymys may increase the chances that a given term may be used to
                represent more than one concept (e.g., "cold" for "low temperature" and for "upper
                respiratory tract viral infection". Parameters for metrics for evaluating the
                completeness of synonym coverage in clinical interface terminologies include:</para>
            <para>
                <emphasis role="underline"><emphasis role="bold">Concept
                    Accuracy</emphasis>:</emphasis> how closely a term's meaning corresponds with
                the underlying concept it represents; and,</para>
            <para>
                <emphasis role="underline"><emphasis role="bold">Synonym
                    Expressivity</emphasis>:</emphasis> how well a term's semantic character matches
                the words in the phrase it is meant to represent rather than the underlying meaning. </para>
            <para>For example a patient describes having a "feathery discomfort occurring across the
                chest". Within a clinical terminology, there is a concept for "chest discomfort" and
                modifiers like "soft" and "anterior chest wall". The end-user selects "noncrushing"
                to represent "feathery". The concept accuracy of "noncrushing" for "feathery" is
                adequate because the two have the same meaning. However, "noncrushing" does not
                fully express the character of "feathery". </para>

        <title>Representation of Assertional Knowledge</title>
        <para>Representation of Assertional Knowledge reaches beyond the patient as the subject of
            record and observations and evaluation results about the patient. It represents
            knowledge that can be applied to the patient's care, e.g. the patient's treatment or
            diagnostics. </para>
        <para>The capability of associating statements enables the use of Assertional Knowledge to
            clinical decision support applications, clinical pathways and general information (“info
