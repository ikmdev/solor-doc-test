            number of sources to make informed clinical decisions. While this data is a critical
            component of providing patients with the best care possible, major challenges exist with
            the accuracy, interoperability, and quality of data that is transmitted within and
            between healthcare systems. Clinical terminology standards are calling for one strategy
            to standardize data collection and improve the quality of patient care with standardized
            and repeatable guidelines for encoding health data. However, these standards often lose
            critical aspects of the original data capture when they are shared with other providers
            and healthcare systems. To enhance the quality, interoperability and usability of
            patient data, the health care industry requires a solution that harmonizes the different
            clinical terminology standards and generates a common model that supports patient care,
            data querying and analysis, public health, and policy making. Interoperable data in an
            ideal world would eliminiate patient harm and other inefficiencies stemmed from data
            misrepresentations and errors in the health care ecosystem. The motivation for this work
            is to explore the pathway to unifying a patient&#8217;s care experience through reliable and
            interoperable data that supports accurate and timely clinical decision support that is
            solely prompted and driven by real-world data and provides real-time assistance to
            clinicians.</p><p>The essential challenge of informatics practice within the healthcare enterprise is to
            quickly deliver a high fidelity reasoned interpretation of principles and facts to the
            point of care&#8212;and then to quickly aggregate these point of care experiences for analytic
            analysis so that new principles and facts can be formulated and validated as part of a
            continuous optimization of healthcare knowledge and delivery. To effectively answer this
            challenge, we must focus on simplification and integration of knowledge assets, and on
            build, test, deploy, and release processes for delivering these assets to the points of
            care and analysis. This focus on perhaps mundane topics is not because we think that
            novelty has no place in our work; rather, that without a focus on aspects of our
            delivery challenge that are often treated as peripheral to the overall problem, we
            cannot achieve reliable, rapid, low-risk knowledge-asset development and delivery in an
            efficient manner.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e13"></a>Overview of IKM Volumes</h2></div></div></div><p>These Integrated Knowledge Management (IKM) Volumes serve as an educational resource

                Integrated Knowledge Management. </p><p>Functional decomposition&#8212;often referred to as a Separation of Concerns
                (SoC)&#8212;across components or sections with a specific purpose is a foundational design
                principle for complex system architecture. SoC allows a complete system to be
                subdivided into distinct sections or components with well-defined functionality and
                dependencies. If successful, this approach allows individual sections to be reused,
                as well as designed, implemented, and updated independently to address emerging
                requirements. This is especially useful and important in a medical context given how
                many different health information and clinical terminology projects are ongoing at
                any given time. Efforts are often uncoordinated and led by disparate and unrelated
                standards development organizations. In these cases, SoC allows teams to
                simultaneously work independently and in coordination with each other and reuse the
                resulting artifacts.</p><p>The architecture presented in these volumes is inspired by core evolutionary
                design principles called &#8220;Understandable, Reproducible, and Useful,&#8221; upon which
                Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT&reg;) development is
                still based. [1, 2] These criteria describe an approach for improving data quality
                and increasing data integrity and agility: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Understandable: </strong></span>The content can be

                        apply the data to the same situations and source data with an equivalent

                        health IT systems. </p></li></ul></div><p>In order to produce highly reliable software, the following tenets must be applied
                within a tooling&#8217;s software development methodology: Use-case driven,
                architecture-centric, iterative and incremental.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Use-case Driven</strong></span>: Defining,

                            shared responsibility of reducing functional complexity across the

                            Independent Validation and Verification (IV&amp;V) methodologies.
                            IV&amp;V methodologies include general-purpose validation approaches
                            conducted by an organization that is not involved in development to
                            generate metrics for data and software quality. From a health
                            information exchange perspective, IV&amp;V can help compare and test
                            source data against requirements of a destination system through manual,
                            semi-automated, and automated inspection of source-to-destination data
                            reviews, thereby helping ensure a sound data strategy intended to reduce
                            patient safety risk and improve data quality for analysis and tracking.

                system upwards of $30 billion per year. The introduction of industry-wide
                interoperability could improve upon these expenditures by reducing adverse events,
                redundant testing, clinician&#8217;s time spent on manual data entry, and reducing length
                of stay, resulting in $1.9 billion, $1.5 billion, $12 billion, and $18 billion in
                savings, respectively.[4-7] Implementing Integrated Knowledge Management will reduce
                the challenges associated with unpredictable, poorly controlled, and reactive health
                IT data. This lack of interoperable data hinders advancements and innovation in the
                healthcare system, including use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data,
                medical communications, research, and international coordination, as new
                technologies must rely on suboptimal data and cannot achieve their full potential.
                [8] The Knowledge Architecture described above will provide the foundation for
                robust configuration management and quality assurance of health IT data while
                allowing for a standardized update and extension process. This approach will support
                increased clinical and laboratory data quality and enable healthcare systems across
                the industry to conduct robust and meaningful data analysis and increase overall
                interoperability, which ultimately enhances the quality of care across all medical
                facilities. </p><p>The purpose of employing the Knowledge Architecture and enabling Integrated
                Knowledge Management can be succinctly described through its benefits: increased
                interoperability, improved patient outcomes, and meaningful data analysis. These
                benefits cut across important aspects of healthcare including regulatory adherence,
                patient-centric care, operational excellence, data management, innovation and
                collaboration, and cost and fraud control. Additionally, incorporating aspects of
                Highly Reliable Organization (HRO) data governance and data quality, HRO principles
                can minimize errors, increase efficiency, and promote a culture of continuous
                learning and improvement, all of which are highly relevant to this work.

                    will have more interoperable capabilities, opening the door for future
                    opportunities to integrate patient data with other agencies, community partners,

            standardized medical terminology to encode health information consistently across
            systems and enterprises. Clinicians require not only objective quantitative measurements
            (e.g., 90 beats per minute for a patient&#8217;s pulse), but also procedural context (e.g.,
            pulse oximetry, manual) about past observations or requests for future interventions.
            While two quantitative measurements may be the same, the procedural information could
            indicate meaningful semantic differences and lead to different clinical interpretation
            and treatment. As information is exchanged across systems, the solution requires a
            common understanding of data, a method to support knowledge representation, and clinical
            decision rules based on common terminology and statements. Each component must address
            an aspect and together need to address the requirements of clinicians. Current HL7
            standard implementations rely on profiles and templates to disambiguate statement and
            terminology and provide sufficient precision for transactions, documents, and
            standards-based Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Therefore, the architectural
            approach described here is applicable to standards organizations developing
            interoperability for enterprise and project-specific implementations in equal
            measure.</p><p>The Knowledge Architecture, by definition, is a framework for clinical information
            that is organized into distinct layers such that each higher layer relies upon artifacts
            from the lower layer. The purpose of the Knowledge Architecture is to standardize
            clinical statements and terminologies by providing abstraction &amp; eliminating
            unnecessary complexity. It helps to do this by:</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Integrating essential clinical terminologies into a coherent

            If employed, this model can help the healthcare ecosystem to individually resolve issues

            the Knowledge Architecture provides the common elements of interoperability, such as:
            object identity, versioning, modularity, and knowledge representation. It includes (a)
            the foundation and building blocks of the common model; (b) how the repeatable
            transformation process of disparate standards into the common model promotes
            interoperability with other environments; and (c) how the modules of the architecture
            are tightly version controlled over time. </p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Terminology Knowledge</strong></span> &#8211; The terminology knowledge
            layer is responsible for structured sets of medical terms and codes that define concepts
            of interest, including descriptions, dialects, language, and semantic hierarchy. SNOMED
            CT&reg;, LOINC&reg;, and RxNorm are part of this layer. It defines what valid codes or
            expressions may be used by higher level layers.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Statement Model</strong></span> &#8211; The statement model layer is
            responsible for defining how data elements are combined to create a statement. This
            layer reuses the artifacts defined in the terminology knowledge layer.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Assertional Knowledge</strong></span> &#8211; The assertional knowledge
            layer makes use of the Terminology Knowledge layer concepts to specify non-defining
            facts that may be used by procedural knowledge algorithms. An example fact might be that
            &#8220;thiazide diuretics treat hypertension.&#8221; Assertional knowledge may also indicate what
            symptoms may be associated with a disorder.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Procedural Knowledge</strong></span> &#8211; The procedural knowledge
            layer, also known as imperative knowledge, is the knowledge exercised in the performance
            of some task. An example would be determining a hypertension treatment plan by analyzing
            a combination of a patient&#8217;s clinical statements and the available assertional
            knowledge. The procedural knowledge is responsible for information about standard ways
            to carry out specific procedures, as well as other procedural guidelines, (e.g.,
            treatment protocols for diseases and order sets focused on certain patient situations).
            Procedural knowledge, together with assertional knowledge, enables clinical decision
            support, quality measurement, and patient safety. This layer relies on the architectural
            foundation and terminology layers, incorporates the statement model for information
            retrieval, and uses assertional knowledge. Procedural knowledge artifacts may include
            clinical alert rules, reminders, etc., that trigger actions or recommend

                managing, analyzing, and exchanging patient health information. [13] Though first
                employed in the 1960s, Health IT entered the scene and obtained widespread adoption
                in the early-1990s promising:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>The enhancement of quality and safety of healthcare,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The ability to more easily measure and reduce the cost of care,</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>The ability to share information with multiple providers across

                        and burnout. [14]</p></li></ul></div><p>The most commonly known forms of Health IT systems, EHRs, or a systematized
                collection of electronically stored patient and population health information, have
                undoubtedly enabled dramatic advancements in patient care, allowing for breakthrough
                technologies with advanced analytical capabilities (e.g., Machine Learning(ML), AI )
                to more easily identify new diseases and develop treatments and reduce the need for
                patients to maintain and carry paper records from provider to provider. </p><p>Despite advancement in technologies like these, a Johns Hopkins study conducted in
                2016 suggested that preventable medical errors, including those due to EHR errors,
                accounted for approximately 250,000 patient deaths every year &#8211; making it the
                third-leading cause of death in the United States. [15] When Controlled Risk
                Insurance Company (CRICO), a medical professional liability organization, identified
                147 cases of patient harm over five years in which an EHR was identified as a
                contributing factor, a staggering 80 percent of these cases involved moderate or
                severe harm to the patient. [16] In total, an estimated $61 million in direct
                payments and legal expenses resulted from these cases, at an average cost of
                $415,000 per case.</p><p>On the surface, exciting new technology has continued to advance in the healthcare
                ecosystem, but cases of patient harm, redundant testing, and over-expenditure
                persists. This begs the question: <span class="bold"><strong>is Health IT truly
                    fulfilling its promises?</strong></span></p><p>Technology has the potential to revolutionize patient care &#8211; concepts like AI and
                ML promise better patient outcomes and reduced clinician burden. However, these
                systems are only as good as the data from which they operate. EHRs, for example,
                were created to provide healthcare automation, patient care and patient access, and
                reduce clinician workload. The advancements in EHRs have had a great impact for
                patients, but users continue to face complications due to the lack of standardized
                data exchange. Unstandardized data stacking has made it difficult to interpret a
                patient&#8217;s chart with accurate data reporting. [17] As far as healthcare technology
                has come, the quality of existing technology platforms is limited through the
                quality of encoded data &#8211; which is where the problem begins.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e231"></a>The Problems with Electronic Health Data</h3></div></div></div><p>While healthcare information originates across a variety of disparate systems and
                organizations, the United States healthcare environment requires interoperable,
                coordinated, and accurate information to support high quality patient care, clinical
                and laboratory research, public health monitoring, and regulatory decision making.
                Many needs must be met in the existing, fragmented healthcare setting which includes
                a network of interconnected information systems.</p><p>Historically, the United States healthcare system has been composed of relatively
                autonomous organizations that maintain loose relationships in support of patient
                care. Patients typically visit one or more primary care clinicians and are
                frequently sent, along with orders and patient data, to specialists, laboratories,
                and other care teams. The observation and interpretation of patients&#8217; healthcare
                data across these settings is crucial to the processes of making safe clinical
                decisions, tracking patient outcomes, anticipating future health problems,
                identifying deviations from expected trends, informing preventive and public health
                measures, supporting clinical research, and providing a legal and historical record.
                [18] </p><p>For example, when a primary care provider records a diabetes diagnosis in the
                provider's local system, it is critical for that system to share the data accurately
                and seamlessly to the pertinent pharmacy and laboratory systems. These systems must
                then in turn communicate with one another and with the primary care system to alert
                the provider that the patient has previously been prescribed gentamicin and has
                recently been given an order for a radiologic examination that requires intravenous
                iodine dye &#8211; both of which are known to affect kidney function. If this information
                is not accurately communicated across healthcare settings in a way that can be
                readily accessed, the patient may face unnecessary harm or risks that could have
                been avoided.</p><p>The following sections aim to spell out some of the current problems with
                electronic health data more clearly.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e242"></a>The Need for Unmatched Precision</h4></div></div></div><p>The degree to which data must maintain precision in healthcare is unmatched in
                    other industries. Health data is unique in its direct association with a
                    person&#8217;s health outcomes. Nuanced concepts exist in patient care settings
                    creating challenges for the representation thereof in data capture and
                    transmission. Laboratory testing on a specimen involves a plethora of biological
                    concepts which must be represented by data in a meaningful way while maintaining
                    precision as well as consumption for other entities or systems in the ecosystem.
                    When an association to a patient&#8217;s health outcomes is combined with such nuanced
                    concepts, exceptional rigor must be taken in the maintenance of data precision
                    and representation.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e247"></a>The Size, Scale, and Complexity of the System</h4></div></div></div><p>The ecosystem of healthcare entities, which share responsibility in the
                    delivery of care, is vast. Various stakeholders include government health
                    authorities, EHR companies, medical device manufacturers, health insurance
                    companies, medical laboratories, hospitals and healthcare systems, and clinical
                    providers among various site types. A healthcare entity&#8217;s data requirements
                    differ in context from other industries regarding the facilitation of patient
                    care and handling of health data in methods that are specific to their context.
                    Industries such as transportation and logistics are more confined to a common
                    context for the data required to successfully facilitate operations. The array
                    of contexts for healthcare entities creates an unsolved challenge for
                    interpreting and exchanging data without compromising its intended meaning.
                </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e252"></a>The Lack of Adherence and Enforcement of Standards </h4></div></div></div><p>Standards in healthcare exist to promote successful interpretation and
                    exchange of data; however, they are not enforced and can experience poor
                    adherence in practice, undercutting their effectiveness and purpose. Despite a
                    significant history of emphasis on healthcare data standards, entities continue
                    to leverage proprietary, or localized, methods for data representation creating
                    inherent and avoidable challenges in care delivery, reporting, and the
                    meaningful application of available technology. Motivations for proprietary or
                    localized data methods cannot be confirmed, however, considerations include
                    protection of market share from competitors and avoidance of public scrutiny for
                    misalignment to standard processes. Maintaining alignment with standards
                    development organizations (SDOs) is resource intensive and invites SDOs to
                    measure and scrutinize an organization against the standard processes to which
                    an entity claims conformity. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e257"></a>The Inability to Share Between Systems</h4></div></div></div><p>Numerous distinct systems and organizations across the healthcare ecosystem
                    lead to a large variation in how data are handled, e.g., data collection, data
                    manipulation, data transmission, data storage, and real-world application. Each
                    system has a proprietary, standard, or ad-hoc information model and is typically
                    configured to satisfy organization-specific needs, resulting in differences in
                    data handling within systems. While this variation is not an innate issue, the
                    difficulty exchanging data between systems and the lack of interoperability
                    compromises data quality and ultimately patient safety. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e262"></a>The Significant Variation in Types of Data Needed</h4></div></div></div><p>Medical data range in format from narrative and textual data to numerical
                    measurements, images, drawings, and more. It is common practice for several
                    different observations of a singular patient to be made concurrently, the
                    observation of the same patient parameter to be made over the course of several
                    points in time, or both. [18] It is also important to keep a record of the
                    circumstances under which data are obtained, further adding to the complexity
                    and volume of data. For example, a simple blood pressure reading may factor if a
                    blood pressure reading is taken on the arm or the leg, whether the patient
                    recently exercised, and what kind of device was used.</p><p>Current approaches for representing data from various, disparate health
                    information systems introduce additional opportunities for inefficiencies,
                    redundancies, and inconsistencies. Unpredictable and denormalized data formats
                    reduce the quality of data processing and the ability to conduct safe and
                    reliable analytics. When incongruent data is repeatedly collated, it requires
                    extensive expertise and resources to synthesize basic trends, information, and
                    insights that should be readily available. A history of numerous scholarly and
                    practical efforts illustrates the challenges of using observational data for
                    safe patient care, comparative effectiveness research, and analyses for biases,
                    workflow differences, and issues with variations in data collection, such as
                    invalid, inconsistent, and missing data.

                or impedes effectiveness. [18] There have been many valuable standards applied
                throughout history such as railroad tracks, telephones, WiFi, and financial
                transactions. The broad goal of the application of standards to electronic health
                data is unambiguous data exchange, or &#8220;interoperability&#8221; &#8211; the ability of two
                parties, either human or machine, to exchange data or information so that it is
                transportable, organizable, and interpretable in an expected format. </p><p>Standards for electronic health data have existed since the creation of the EHR in
                the 1960s. Computer engineers responsible for EHR development were tasked with
                representing health concepts in a digital format that could be shared with users and
                connected systems for common interpretation. In 1965, the Systematized Nomenclature
                of Pathology (SNOP) was developed to provide a common way to describe morphology and
                anatomy. A decade later, SNOP expanded into its known name today, Systematized
                Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terminology (SNOMED CT&reg;). As the adoption of EHRs
                increased during the 1980s, Health Level Seven International (HL7) was formed in
                1987 as a non-profit, American National Standards Institute (ANSI)-accredited
                standards development organization to develop standards that provide global health
                data interoperability. Since then, several SDOs in the healthcare space have
                appeared and, along with HL7 and SNOMED CT&reg;, continued to commit resources to the
                development and adoption of standardized health data processes. In 2004, under the
                United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Office of the
                National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) was born to promote a
                national health information technology infrastructure and oversee its development.
                While ONC is not a SDO, it works in close coordination with SDOs to support the
                adoption and application of health data standards in the U.S. </p><p>While interoperable health data is a complex and nuanced topic, a primary
                component is maintaining the meaning and intent of clinical data from the point of
                consumption throughout the transmission and use of that data across various systems.
                As data is exchanged within and between multiple healthcare systems, the original
                provider&#8217;s meaning and intent must be electronically communicated in a way that,
                upon receipt, receiving systems and providers can understand in an identical manner.
                Data exchange standards provide a formal process for defining specific constructs to
                be exchanged between machines and must be used to support this seamless transfer of
                data.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e278"></a>Structure and Meaning</h4></div></div></div><p>In simple terms, <span class="italic">Structure </span>and<span class="italic"> Meaning </span>are two considerations to ensure data

                    interoperability.</p><p><span class="italic">Structure</span> is the ability of systems to
                    agree on how to format the data. Structural interoperability ensures the
                    seamless communication of the data&#8217;s structure between systems but does not
                    guarantee that the receiving system will interpret the data with the original
                    intent. Web pages, for instance, are developed using HTML or XML to ensure
                    structural interoperability. While this guarantees a web page can be read by any
                    machine with a web browser, it does not ensure the meaning of that page is
                    identical across machines. There are a variety of healthcare structural
                    standards, including FHIR, HL7 Version 2 Messaging (HL7 v2), and Consolidated
                    Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA). </p><p>To understand structural interoperability, consider the two sentences below.

                    health data ecosystem which share direct relationships and interfaces in the
                    exchange of clinical data. Healthcare interfaces must leverage various existing
                    standards for <span class="italic">structure </span>and<span class="italic"> meaning</span> and use them together in integrated ways.
                    An electronic interface provides an avenue, or connection point, for sharing
                    data in a meaningful, coherent way between two disparate systems. Without an
                    interface, two disparate systems are unable to communicate in a common language.
                    In the U.S. and elsewhere, the most common and accepted messaging structural
                    standard for EHR-to- Reference Lab interfacing is the Health Level Seven (HL7)
                    Version 2.x (V2.x) standard. While other messaging standards exist and can be
                    used, the HL7 V2.x messaging standard, first released in 1987, is used in 95% of
                    U.S. healthcare organizations and in more than 35 countries. [35] </p><p>To illustrate how standards for <span class="italic">structure
                        </span>and<span class="italic"> meaning</span> may be currently
                    implemented, we will explore a scenario of a typical hospital-to-reference lab
                    order message generated by a hospital EHR system sent electronically to a
                    Reference Lab. This laboratory order message is received, processed, and acted
                    upon by which the laboratory will perform the test specified in the order
                    message received. After a laboratory test is performed and a test result is
                    available, the Reference Laboratory in this scenario will return a Laboratory
                    Result message to the hospital EHR system.</p><p><a class="xref" href="#ErroneousLoincMapping" title="Figure&nbsp;1.4.&nbsp;Erroneous LOINC&reg; Mapping">Figure&nbsp;1.4, &#8220;Erroneous LOINC&reg; Mapping&#8221;</a> below shows an example of an HL7 v2
                    Observation (OBX) segment from two different mock lab result messages. In this
                    scenario, a laboratory has conducted two distinct blood glucose tests on two
                    distinct specimen sources. For the first test, a specimen from serum or plasma
                    was used. For the second test, the specimen was from whole blood. The figure
                    below illustrates how the HL7 v2 <span class="italic">structure</span>
                    standard is populated using existing terminology standards for <span class="italic">meaning, </span>in this case LOINC&reg;. In the first HL7
                    segment for test 1, the LOINC&reg; code is for a &#8220;Glucose [Mass/volume] in Serum or
                    Plasma&#8221;, whereas for test 2, the LOINC&reg; code is for a &#8220;Glucose [Mass/volume] in
                    Blood&#8221;. Different tests were conducted. Therefore, different LOINC&reg; codes were
                    used in the HL7 v2 messages. The local laboratory information system and EHR
                    also define and use their own code systems to encode the tests; these are called
                    &#8220;local codes.&#8221; Although not universal, local codes are another way for health
                    information systems to represent <span class="italic">meaning</span> for
                    clinical concepts. The HL7 v2 observation data in <a class="xref" href="#ErroneousLoincMapping" title="Figure&nbsp;1.4.&nbsp;Erroneous LOINC&reg; Mapping">Figure&nbsp;1.4, &#8220;Erroneous LOINC&reg; Mapping&#8221;</a> shows blue text representing a local code,
                    and the observation data denoted in red represents a corresponding LOINC&reg; code. </p><div class="figure"><a name="ErroneousLoincMapping"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;1.4.&nbsp;Erroneous LOINC&reg; Mapping</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/Erroneous%20Loinc%20Mapping.svg" align="middle" width="297" alt="Erroneous LOINC&reg; Mapping"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The figure shows how the same local code can be erroneously mapped to
                    different LOINC&reg; codes and transmitted in a Lab Result message. In this case
                    example, we see the same laboratory conducting two distinct tests and encoding
                    each test with a different LOINC&reg; code; however, both are mapped to the same
                    local code. This mock scenario highlights one example of the myriad of
                    interoperability challenges faced in healthcare today. [35] Successful
                    interoperability is dependent on either using universal code systems for data
                    capture or through mapping local content to a universal code system. Local code
                    systems serve the same function as universal coding systems such as SNOMED CT&reg;
                    and LOINC&reg;, however are internal identification schemas that consist of a set of
                    local codes and their associated definitions. </p><p>Because the receiving system will parse the identical local codes from the two
                    mock HL7 v2 segments above, it will interpret the lab result as having been
                    produced from identical lab tests. In simpler terms, the receiving system will
                    interpret these messages as the same glucose test with a &#8220;count of 2
                    observations&#8221; rather than two different glucose tests, each with a &#8220;count of 1
                    observation.&#8221; Since the source specimen and lab tests are different, but
                    represented identically in the data transmission, semantic meaning is lost
                    compromising patient safety and accurate reporting. The receiving system will
                    interpret these two HL7 v2 segments as meaning the &#8220;same thing&#8221; or representing
                    the &#8220;same glucose test&#8221;; however, any terminologist or laboratory professional
                    would interpret this as &#8220;different glucose tests.&#8221;</p><p>To improve the quality and safety of patient care, there is a need to refine
                    data exchange within the healthcare ecosystem. We often hear comments as, &#8220;Why
                    is the problem of data exchange in healthcare so difficult? After all, other
                    industries&#8212;banking, for example&#8212; have solved the problem. Healthcare
                    transactions can&#8217;t be that much more complicated than those managed by a
                    geographically distributed, multiple line-of-business banking system.&#8221;</p><p>While other industries, like banking, have resolved issues with their
                    transmission and exchange of complex banking data across geographical locations
                    and between numerous unaffiliated businesses, the complexity with healthcare
                    data arises, in part, because neither the standards for structure (i.e.,
                    statement model) nor standards for meaning (i.e., terminology model) can
                    represent clinical data alone in the current data structures. Both types of
                    models can be arbitrarily complex, and, at some point, semantics not represented
                    in one must be represented in the other if one is to achieve interoperability.
