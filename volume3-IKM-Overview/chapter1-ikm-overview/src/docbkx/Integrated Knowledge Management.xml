     <title>IKM Overview</title>
    <section>
        <title>Motivation for IKM</title>
        <para>Knowledge management (KM) is an important process organizations use to identify,
            organize, and disseminate information and is providing greater value and insights into
            data with the emergence of technologies and advanced analytics, such as artificial
            intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Individuals and organizations alike are
            continuously generating data which may sit in siloed databases but, with the appropriate
            tools, can be aggregated across platforms, analyzed, and utilized. However, the flow of
            data through systems can lead to a myriad of issues including loss of meaning, inability
            to aggregate data, misinterpretation, and more. Achieving coordinated and standardized
            ways to integrate data across systems is an important tenant of integrated knowledge
            management (IKM). </para>
        <para>These issues are no different for healthcare and laboratory data. The introduction of
            the clinical information systems, including electronic health record (EHR) systems and
            laboratory information systems (LIS), in the 1960’s revolutionized the way an
            individual’s health data was stored. Health data went from static data recorded in paper
            records to dynamic, encoded knowledge stored in informational systems and introduced the
            ability to aggregate and examine these data points to generate new ideas and solve
            problems. Removing ourselves from the idealized state of full knowledge integration, the
            current landscape is composed of a range of EHR platforms, LISs, users, standards
            organizations, and agencies, all of which employ their own methods for collecting,
            recording, and using healthcare data. The healthcare system’s transformation into a
            digitalized health information system was quickly adopted but several core high
            reliability organization (HRO) principles were excluded, including ensuring the system
            was interoperable, data was of the highest quality, and patient safety was prioritized. </para>
        <para>Several organizations have emerged to address these issues through industry coding
            standards and implementation guidance. However, these have fallen short of ensuring high
            quality data with a common representation or standardization across the healthcare
            ecosystem. Standards including Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms®
            (SNOMED CT®), Logical Observations Identifiers Names and Codes® (LOINC®), National
            Library of Medicine’s codification of the U.S. pharmacopeia (RxNorm) and others exist to
            address the variation in healthcare data and resulting inefficiencies by working with
            terminology, standards, and meaning. Each organization follows a set of rules that
            govern the standards and add structure. However, even the best-meaning user may
            interpret the use of standards differently, highlighting the need to move beyond the
            reliance on standards alone. Additionally, users may be unaware of their
            misinterpretation of standards during system implementations, configuration, and
            maintenance due to a lack of adequate feedback mechanisms. The integration of the
            above-mentioned organizations, users, and standards are important to create an
            interoperable and high-quality healthcare system. </para>
        <para>Currently, implementers must know how to work with all the existing standards and be
            familiar with their respective rules and formats. Through this body of work, we are
            advancing a reference demonstration of an IKM environment that can be used by various
            stakeholders in the laboratory ecosystem to easily view, manage, and integrate existing
            knowledge standards (e.g., SNOMED CT® , LOINC®) in a singular location, ultimately
            allowing users to identify relationships between disparate knowledge sets. This work
            will help set the foundation for a common model that would eventually help promote
            collaboration across standards-development organizations, vendors, and
            provider-organizations, improving interoperability of laboratory data across the entire
            ecosystem. Through IKM, all standards work together under one data model with tooling to
            work across standards and reduce redundancies. IKM can benefit the healthcare ecosystem
            and society by improving patient outcomes, allowing meaningful data analyses, and
            increasing interoperability. </para>

        <title>The Problem IKM Addresses </title>
        <para>In healthcare, organizations that help achieve standardized health data are referred
            to as Standards Development Organizations (SDOs). SDOs exist in every industry, but in
            health Information Technology (IT) the following are key examples: <informaltable>

        <para>The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC)
            currently oversees and promotes SDOs and supports the adoption and application of health
            data standards in the U.S. healthcare space. The structure and meaning of data must be
            maintained to achieve full data integrity and a truly interoperable system. FHIR is an
            example of a standard that works to maintain the structure of data as it flows through
            systems, while terminology organizations including SNOMED CT®, RxNorm, and LOINC® work
            to maintain the meaning of data. With the many existing SDOs and agencies pushing their
            adoption, issues such as overlapping coding standards, loss of meaning, and partial
            representation continue to exist. </para>
        <para>While medical terminology standards exist, the way they record, manage, and represent
            terminologies differs, leading to redundant and duplicative ways to reference the same
            concept. This leads to variations in clinical data exchange across the ecosystem as
            organizations use inconsistent and varied concept representation. Interoperability
            specifications aim to force these terminologies to adhere to predefined concepts, code
            systems, and reusable value sets. Although there are standardized codes and formats,
            there are many ways to use these standards. </para>
        <para>To address the current issues with disparate standards, a common model and IKM
            capabilities are needed to support the integration and management of clinical
            terminology and local concepts to support increased data quality and interoperable
            clinical information. [5] IKM and implementation of a common model can support the
            integration of disparate standards, provide version control, and support extensions that
            otherwise do not exist. A common model for knowledge standards addresses the differences
            in management and structure across disparate terminology standards, local concepts, and
            code lists/value sets. Employing the architectural design principle of Separation of
            Concerns (SoC), a system can be divided into sections and each section can be addressed
            and allowed to evolve irrespective of other sections. In IKM and its knowledge
            architecture, the foundational layer provides the common elements of interoperability
            including object identity, versioning, modularity, and knowledge representation. In this
            foundational architecture layer, we find the shared module system where version and
            configuration management provide the foundation for interoperability and the common
            model. </para>
        <para>A common model will unify disparate standards and address the following points when
            designing an interoperable healthcare system:</para>

        <title>Goals of IKM</title>
        <para>One of the goals of this body of work is to develop both a common model and the
            necessary tooling to support the implementation of the common model and IKM
            capabilities. Our work aims to improve patient care and safety through interoperable,
            high-quality data, and accurate transmission within and between healthcare systems.
            Improved data quality will cascade to other refinements within the healthcare ecosystem,
            such as improved research capabilities, identification of real-world data trends, and
            real-time public health information. A standardized way to represent medical terminology
            must be developed to ensure new concepts are represented in a uniform and repeatable way
            and support the conversion of existing terminology standards into a common model while
            maintaining meaning, associated concepts, semantics, hierarchies, and other critical
            information and relationships. </para>
        <para>To support IKM, an implementation of a common model for knowledge standards must
            support a variety of functionalities across all knowledge standards and frameworks,
            including:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Import</emphasis> – The data model must be able to pull
                    and visualize data from LOINC®, SNOMED CT®, and other terminology standards into
                    the model’s data elements. Displaying the disparate terminology standards in a
                    single place will allow users and authors to compare commonalities and
                    differences between standards, identify equivalent concepts, and understand how
                    concepts relate to one another.</para>

                    data into the standardized format while maintaining meaning and any associated
                    concepts. Editing will support the identification of unnecessary or redundant
                    concepts caused by unstandardized formatting of concepts across terminology
                    standards. Editing within the model will also support a uniform way to safely
                    and reliably update, evolve, and version content over time as new concepts,
                    relationships, and information are uncovered.</para>

            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Authoring</emphasis> – The model must support the
                    development of new concepts using a standardized and repeatable format to
                    maintain lossless capture and transmission of data (including identification and
                    inclusion of related concepts), incorporate new concepts such as Long
                    coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and meet standardized terminology
                    formatting.</para>

        </itemizedlist>
        <para>Tooling is needed to support IKM and the common model. The tooling will serve as an

        <title>TermINology Knowledge Architecture (Tinkar) Overview</title>
        <para>Today’s healthcare system uses certain information systems to capture and manage
            clinical statements and terminologies. While multiple information systems and
            terminology standards exist, these standards represent and format equivalent concepts,
            semantics, and models in different ways and manage new concept release cycles and
            versioning updates asynchronously. Due to this disparate terminology representation,
            identifying equivalent concepts, transmitting data without losing key details or
            meaning, and ensuring the quality of data is a challenge. Through this body of work, we
            are aiming to improve IKM capabilities and advancing an existing Health Level Seven
            International (HL7) project within the Vocabulary Working Group known as the ‘Guidelines
            for a Standardized Terminology Knowledge base”, also known as TermINology Knowledge
            Architecture (Tinkar). Tinkar is intended to provide an architecture that delivers
            integrated terminology to the healthcare enterprise and its information systems. Tinkar
            addresses the differences in management and structure across reference terminology, and
            with local concepts and code lists/value sets. [5]</para>
        <para>Tinkar is a self-describing and machine processed knowledge architecture that allows
            for effective and scalable querying of data, concepts, and information. Using locally
            defined concepts, Tinkar can integrate various terminology standards into the common
            model by accommodating, managing, and defining granular components and their respective
            data sources to support interoperability of semantics. Having the ability to manage
            complex and individual elements of each standard then allows continual process
            improvement, including rapid extension development. Edits to concepts or newly authored
            concepts in Tinkar can be tested and previewed before deployment to a live environment
            and historic versioning of meta data is perpetually maintained to support iterative
            authoring, development, and versioning. [5]</para>
        <para>Tinkar aims to improve the quality of patient care across the healthcare enterprise by
            creating a cross-cutting and common model that can integrate other terminology standards
            and use a repeatable and standardized process to convert disparate clinical statements
            and terminologies into high-quality, interoperable, and exportable clinical data. The
            four main problems that Tinkar and a common model can address are:</para>
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Suboptimal ability to identify equivalent concepts within and between

                            identification of these findings as equivalent and create a relationship
                            between the concepts.</para>

                            to rapidly develop and version concepts in response to real-time

            through collaboration with federal agencies and the Systemic Harmonization and
            Interoperability Enhancement for Laboratory Data (SHIELD) collaborative community.
            SHIELD aims to support increased patient safety through improved interoperability,
            transmission, and quality of laboratory data between and within healthcare systems.

        <title>IKM Challenges</title>
        <para>While IKM promises a revolutionary way to improve the quality and interoperability of
            healthcare data in the name of improved patient safety and patient outcomes, achieving a
            truly integrated ecosystem will pose a variety of challenges. Creating an IKM
            architecture is itself a major undertaking, but will require a deep, fundamental
            understanding and a detailed approach to address the following challenges. These
            challenges are not exhaustive and will evolve as this work continues.</para>

            <title>Federal Regulation</title>
            <para>As with any new or emerging technology, a variety of Federal agencies will need to
                play a major part in the implementation of an IKM system. Not only is their review
                and approval of the proposed system a necessity before implementation with patient
                facing healthcare systems, but the federal government will also need to develop
                incentives to encourage the private sector to participate and meet the minimum
                requirements needed to support IKM. Due to the inherent complexity and holistic
                approach to data, IKM will require multiple federal agencies to support and drive
                participation, like:</para>

            <para>It is critical to coordinate with federal agencies as early as possible to gather
                and incorporate their feedback, provide extensive information detailing our work,
                the intended goals, and benefits, and collaborate on requirements to support
                improved data quality and patient safety. A detailed stakeholder engagement plan
                that details timelines, stakeholder dependencies, and required actions is required
                to efficiently develop these requirements.</para>

            <title>Stakeholder Incentives</title>
            <para>Federal agencies will need to develop minimum requirements and incentives to
                encourage higher education, private sector, and other stakeholders to participate.
                Meeting the minimum requirements for data collection and data transmission will
                require changes to the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) that standardize
                data entry requirements, representation of data elements, and transmission of data
                on the front and back end of healthcare and laboratory systems. These could be
                extensive changes depending on the age and current data collection of the systems.
                Before hospitals and laboratories commit both financial and personnel resources to
                perform gap assessments, identify areas of improvement, implement changes, train
                staff and users, and sustain updates, regulators and implementers will need to use
                statistical analysis and evidence-based discussions to highlight the current
                problems with data and how these problems directly impact or relate to each
                stakeholder on an individualized level. Demonstrations showing how improvements to
                patient safety, optimization of data collection, transmission, and querying, and the
                IKM environment with statistics analysis will address these current state issues and
                use financial incentives to encourage stakeholders to achieve the optimized future
                state we are working towards.</para>

            <title>Coordination Across Standards</title>
            <para>A defining feature of IKM is working to harmonize various terminology standards
                using a common language to standardize data capture while maintain meaning and
                associated concepts throughout transmission and storage. This requires working with
                a variety of terminology standards that asynchronously represent, update, manage,
                and version concepts. The IKM architecture will require a robust and standardized
                process to track changes across terminology standards and version Tinkar concepts
                appropriately in a repeatable way. Changes will need to be made in real time and
                will need to communicate the intricacies of updates, test the validity and
                functionality of changes, and maintain Status, Time, Author,Module, and Path (STAMP)
                principles. Changes to concepts may occur concurrently as terminology standards
                release updates and will need to be tested and validated using the Tinkar authoring
                environment.</para>
