        <para>SHIELD is a public-private collaboration that started in 2015 with a singular focus:
            improving the interoperability and utility of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test data. To
            accomplish their mission of being able to “Describe the same test the same way anywhere
            in the Healthcare ecosystem”, SHIELD is working to develop a solution that focuses

        <title>Real World Evidence (RWE) and Standards Overview</title>
        <para>Real world evidence (RWE) using RWD collected as part of routine clinical care, has
            been heralded as an answer to many of the woes of our medical system. A vision has been
            made popular that suggests a wealth of untapped data – electronic health records (EHR),
            medical imaging, mobile apps, and more recently low-cost gene sequencing and wearable
            devices, unlocked using artificial intelligence and cloud computing – is a path to
            better diagnostics, personalized treatments, and early disease prevention for millions.
            Data interoperability of health data may help medicine realize the future in the same
            way in which other industries have advanced – such as banking, the “internet of things”
            and online shopping, thereby stressing the importance of establishing the Laboratory
            Interoperability Data Repository (LIDR) and related infrastructure. The vision of a
            national interoperable health information system has been elusive; however, because of
            clinical care data in data silos, incompatible health information technology (IT)
            systems, and proprietary software that make health information difﬁcult to exchange,
            analyze, and interpret. </para>
        <para>Given the number of distinct information systems and care delivery organizations in
            the ecosystem (e.g., primary care, specialists, laboratories, other care teams),
            multiple variations exist in how data is collected, manipulated, transmitted, and
            effectively used. The problem is not the systems per se, but rather the difficulty of
            data exchange between systems or data incompatibility. Medical data range in format from
            narrative, textual data to numerical measurements, recorded signals, photographs,
            drawings, and more. There is also the challenge of the volume of data recorded. Several
            different observations of a patient are often made concurrently, the observation of the
            same patient parameter made at several points in time, or both. [1] It is also important
            to keep a record of the circumstances under which data are obtained. For example, is a
            blood pressure reading taken on the arm or the leg, had the patient just exercised, what
            kind of device was used, etc. </para>
        <para>Representing these data in various, disparate information systems introduces
            additional opportunities for inefficiencies, redundancies, and inconsistencies. Each
            system has a proprietary, standard, or ad-hoc information model and is typically
            configured to satisfy organization-specific needs, resulting in differences in data
            capture and storage between and within systems. This is the current reality, as
            electronic health data are represented in unpredictable and denormalized forms. This
            reduces the quality of data processing and ability to conduct safe and reliable
            analytics. Numerous scholarly and practical efforts illustrate the challenges of using
            observational data for safe patient care, comparative effectiveness research, and
            analysis including recording biases, workflow differences, and issues with variations in
            data collection, such as invalid, inconsistent, and missing data. [2] </para>
        <para>Aggregated RWE and reliable analytics would benefit from implementable methodologies
            that address interoperability and data aggregation gaps to help establish a health data
            ecosystem capable for widespread use in regulatory efforts, public health surveillance,
            research, and care delivery. To achieve safe and effective information retrieval and
            reproducible search and query practices across various settings, the following
            constructs are needed to successfully build, maintain, and analyze data/resources across
            key biomedical concepts of interest. </para>
        <section>
            <title>Data Interoperability Tooling Overview</title>
            <para>A generalized definition of interoperable health data that supports reliable RWE
                analytics asserts that data recorded and encoded at the time of creation should
                accurately reflect the meaning intended by the health care professional who created
                the data. In the current ecosystem, it can be a very manual, error-prone, and
                sometimes challenging process to determine if data received from entity A is
                equivalent to data from entity B and if it is interpreted across each setting as the
                data was originally intended at the point of origin. Data interoperability tooling,
                such as a Knowledge Management Platform, that can ingest disparate health data and
                knowledge sources and harmonize them into a common model and change management
                system could help in ensuring that the data are reliably computed and/or transmitted
                between health information systems without any change in meaning. The original
                meaning as intended by the first entity should be fully communicated electronically
                and understood upon receipt equally by the receiving entity. This type of knowledge
                platform could serve as data interoperability tooling to be able to determine
                equivalence between concepts and data sets from various organizations. </para>
            <para>To facilitate such tooling, data must be represented by a normal form that can
                safely and reliably support data analysis that can be used to aggregate data
                creating using standard or non-standard input form or exchange mechanism. Examples
                of such data models include Health Level 7 (HL7) Clinical Information Modeling
                Initiative (CIMI) efforts, including the HL7 Analysis Normal Form (ANF)
                specification. The model to support a Knowledge Management Platform should meet the
                following evolutionary design criteria: </para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Understandable: The data model for normalizing disparate health data can
                        be processed by health IT systems and understood by most healthcare
                        providers without reference to private or inaccessible information.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Reproducible: Multiple users or systems apply the model and normal form to
                        the same situations and source data with an equivalent result.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Useful: The model is fit-for-purpose—it has practical value for data
                        analysis, in support of clinical decision support, research, and population
                        health that requires information aggregated across health IT systems.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            <para>Normalization of disparate health data and knowledge is defined as "the ability to
                identify every representational format that confers the same meaning as being
                equivalent (i.e., unambiguous representation)." [3] To be clear, the
                transformation/normalization would involve a data instance to data instance
                transformation. An example could be John Doe's Systolic Blood Pressure measurement
                taken on June 4, 2019 represented as a Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR)
                Observation instance, which is then transformed to a common data model/normal form
                instance representing this same data. Transformation, in this case, is not a simple
                endeavor that one can hope to implement on clinical data. It will likely involve
                navigating disparate data structure trees and include variable representations to
                then generate a well-formed terminology expression. It is most likely possible to
                target sub-domains for consistent transformation, such as all quantitative
                laboratory results, but in some cases, it may be that each detailed clinical model
                needs its own unique transformation. </para>
            <para>Currently, there are three basic categories of errors that might be associated
                with attempts at normalizing clinical data representation: </para>
            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Errors associated with normalization of content of the terminology </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Errors associated with normalization of the semantics of the terminology
                    </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Errors that result from ambiguous or misleading interaction between the
                        structured clinical input and presentation of compound terminology to
                        clinician end-users </para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
            <para>A number of options exist for expressing transformation logic and for executing
                the transformation on specific instances of clinical data for normalization. These
                range from transformation languages to expensive middleware options commonly used in
                healthcare interfaces. The suitability of a chosen transformation language highly
                depends on the format of the source data, and the quality and accuracy of the
                transformation is left to the transformation author. Examples of transformation
                languages include extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT), FHIR
                Mapping Language, and Query/View/Transformation (QVT). Often referred to as “data
                wrangling”, these transformation processes often require mapping data from one “raw”
                data form into another format with the intent of making it more valuable for
                downstream purposes such as analytics. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Data Liquidity Overview</title>
            <para>To support RWE analytics and data aggregation, there is a desire to “reduce the
                amount of data wrangling” and one-off transformations across the ecosystem and
                instead enable “data liquidity”, or the ability of data to flow throughout the
                health data ecosystem easily and securely so that it is quickly available to
                clinicians, decision makers, laboratories, patients, and others when they need. A
                robust information architecture and scalable solution to enable this ideal state
                requires a common understanding of data and a method to support
                knowledge-representation and assertional and procedural rules based on common
                terminology and statement models. If a shareable architecture were able to be
                implemented across the ecosystem, health data and knowledge could potentially be
                represented in a way that is both applicable at the interoperability-enterprise and
                project-specific levels. </para>
            <para>Another pragmatic methodology would be to engage vendors and incentivize them to
                implement an open, common data model and produce shareable output in interoperable,
                reproducible, and understandable formats that could then be ingested by other
                systems. Major U.S. EHR vendors, which represent > 80% of the U.S. healthcare EHR
                implementations, represent a possible avenue to normalizing and aggregating
                EHR-based data in the U.S. on a broad scale. Individually, each vendor has
                independently attempted to create such clinical data resources and product offerings
                for their user communities. These efforts entail attempts to align, normalize and
                aggregate the EHR data held by each individual client into a large, de-identified
                data enclave for purposes of data analytics, quality improvement and research.
                Unfortunately, these independent efforts are proprietary and do not extend beyond
                the vendor-user community. Further, the data normalization and representation
                process remains a "black box" and cannot be independently verified for semantic
                correctness, data and information loss or gains, or appropriate application of
                metadata standards. In fact, these vendor-centric efforts face the same issues with
                vendor-centric data alignment and reuse on a smaller scale. [4-5] Despite these
                weaknesses, an opportunity exists to collaborate with EHR vendors to normalize and
                apply metadata standards safely and reliably to the EHR data created by their
                clients. To capitalize on this opportunity, vendors must be allowed to create unique
                value in their data offerings to the clientele but also be required to expose these
                data to the broader community such that data collected by numbers of vendors can be
                safely and reliably aggregated for research, public health, clinical quality
                improvement and regulatory uses as described by SHIELD. </para>

            <title>Metadata overview</title>
            <para>An important construct for enabling RWE analytics, knowledge management, data
                integration, and decision support, is adoption and reproducible encoding of health
                data using biomedical terminologies. Acceleration and development of EHR systems
                have precipitated the emergence of “standard terminologies” and their widespread
                adoption in the health data community. These standard terminologies include
                Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT®), the Logical
                Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC®) and RxNorm. </para>
            <para>While these standards are widely implemented and adopted, aggregation and
                analytics can be difficult because there is no standard representation across these
                terminologies. Traversing the data models of these various terminology standards in
                an integrated way is non-trivial because SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and RxNorm each use
                different formalisms and tools for their representation. Various terminologies have
                different semantics, models, release cycles, and versioning mechanisms. [6] </para>
            <para>Ideally, to support RWE analytics and aggregation, enterprise terminology requires
                an integrated terminology using a common representation (metadata) and management. A
                common terminology model, such as HL7 Standardized Terminology Knowledge Base (also
                known as TermINology Knowledge Architecture [Tinkar]) would allow analytics on top
                of aggregated RWE data sets the following [7]: </para>

            <title>Analytic Environments Overview</title>
            <para>Integrated analytics environments assist in creating and automating data pipelines
                and workflows to deliver actionable information to a wide variety of end users.
                These environments extract data from various data sources, ideally into an
                integrated knowledge base, housed in a central ecosystem – thereby reducing data
                silos, enhancing security and governance, and eliminating system redundancies. For
                data analytics conducted using RWE, analytics environments will be dependent on a
                variety of knowledge bases and datasets that may have some common fields but also
                differing fields. A vast variety of biomedical and administrative knowledge present
                the basis for RWE analytics and knowledge management of these disparate datasets is
                a major element of consideration to facilitate RWE analytics. Knowledge management
                includes the creation, discovery, and application of knowledge assets to facilitate
                sharing and re-use across the ecosystem. </para>
            <para>The ability to use interoperable syntax and semantics between data sources is a
                critical requirement to support effective knowledge management and reliable
                analytics of disparate RWE datasets. Use of industry standards for syntax and
                semantics helps facilitate integration; however, not all implementation
                considerations are planned for and adopted and additional efforts are needed to
                advance standards to improve data quality. The standards themselves update over time
                and there is a requirement for knowledge management in analytics environments to
                consider how standards and underlying code sets have changed over time and relaying
                these changes to data analysts and users who interpret data reports to best

            within and between systems while maintaining meaning and all associated and pertinent
            information. Interoperability primarily focuses on two aspects, structural and meaning
            interoperability. </para>

            between and within both organizations and standards poses as a major patient safety
            issue in the healthcare system. A test with a given LIVD LOINC code can be performed
            within a lab and as it is transmitted to the LIS, the test can be assigned a different
            LIS LOINC code that does not capture all of the pertinent information. Even within the
            organization the interoperability of data is threatened, so when data is then
            transferred from the Lab’s LIS to a hospitals EHR that lack of data interoperability can
            compound as the LIS LOINC code is assigned another, potentially different EHR LOINC
            code.</para>

        <title>Clinical Statement Overview</title>
        <para>A clinical statement is a general informatics term. It is a definite and clear
            representation that a clinically significant fact or situation was observed to exist or
            happened, or that a particular procedure was requested. A clinical statement can be
            expressed as a narrative that provides a written account that can be naturally read by
            humans, as well as a normal form which is a machine-processable representation of the
            statement's data as a standardized and encoded fundamental form. [8]</para>
        <para>Clinical Input Form is also a general informatics term. It describes the manner by
            which clinicians author clinical statements and enter them into their organizations’
            EHR. Clinical Input Forms (CIFs) have an impact as to how information is presented to
            the clinicians and how they enter the data. CIFs might be generated by natural language
            processing or may use models that constrain structured input to allow only certain
            values to be entered, such as a drop-down list or radio button, or breaking up large
            chunks of related information into smaller parts. [8]</para>
        <para>Today, clinical statements are often represented in unpredictable and denormalized
            forms, which makes reliable and safe decision support challenging and reduces the
            quality of other types of data processing. ANF is an approach to clinical statements
            that ensures the statement representation is reproducible and scalable, with the
            adherence to principles of being simple, reproducible, and use case driven, with a clean
            separation between statement concerns and terminology concerns. [8]</para>
        <para>In linguistics, words have their very own definitions, however, if it’s not paired
            with proper sentence structure, the words convey very little meaning and are open to
            interpretation. When this framework is applied to the healthcare system, clinical data,
            and more specifically clinical statements, we need <emphasis role="italic"

            <para><emphasis role="italic">The recent acceleration in the deployment of EHR systems
                    has precipitated the emergence of a few terminologies and their wide adoption in

                    Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT®) and the Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and
                    Codes (LOINC®), have become inter- national standards. The last one, RxNorm, is

        <title>Modularity and Versioning Overview</title>
        <para>When dealing with the complexities of the various architectural layers of the
            informatics architectural separation of concerns, one of the most important things to
            note is that any one of the architectural layers will be undergoing modifications at any
            given point in time, as various Standards Development Organizations go through each of
            their various drafting, balloting, and approval lifecycles. Therefore, it is important
            to establish a foundation for Solor as a versioning and modularity architecture that
            allows changes and subchanges to be referenced uniquely so that all parties can be on
            the same page as to a particular version.</para>
        <para>For example, the following diagram shows how each module could be given a unique
            version number and contain all layers of the architectural stack. In the instance that a
            particular versioned module needs to be extended, an extension module could be added to
            that main versioned module without the need to go to a completely new full module
            version. This arrangement accounts for the constant change in the healthcare
            interoperability space while still allowing two organizations to baseline on the same
            version for testing or exchange purposes.</para>
        <para>In software engineering, modularity refers to the extent to which software may be
            divided into smaller modules. Modularity emphasizes separating the functionality of a
            program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything
            necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality. A module interface
            expresses the elements that are provided and required by the module, and the elements
            defined in the interface are detectable by other modules. Modular programming is closely
            related to object-oriented programming, having the same goal of facilitating
            construction of large software programs and systems by decomposition into smaller pieces
            (i.e., 'polymorphism by encapsulation' or 'composition over inheritance'). With modular
            programming, concerns are separated such that modules perform logically discrete
            functions, interacting through well-defined interfaces. Often modules form a directed
            acyclic graph (DAG); in this case, a cyclic dependency between modules is seen as
            indicating that these should be a single module. In the case where modules do form a DAG
            they can be arranged as a hierarchy, where the lowest-level modules are independent,
            depending on no other modules, and higher-level modules depend on lower-level ones. A
            particular program or library is a top-level module of its own hierarchy, but can in
            turn be seen as a lower-level module of a higher-level program, library, or
            system.</para><figure xml:id="VersioningandModules">

        <title>Safety Systems Thinking and High Reliability Organization (HRO) Overview</title>
        <para>Today’s current state for knowledge management constructs lack a standardized approach
            to ensure the quality of data as it is entered or transferred into the health care and
            laboratory systems. Without a clear and repeatable way to verify the accuracy of
            information within an EHR or laboratory system, there are opportunities for hazards and
            patient safety issues to emerge. Our team will design a system based on a Safety Systems
            Thinking approach and High Reliability Organization (HRO) principles that can improve
            the quality, reliability, and interoperability of data and address the concerns with
            current knowledge management constructs. We will use prior work and research from
            industry leaders and subject matter experts (SMEs) as foundational building blocks as we
            continue to research laboratory and health care systems, medical terminology standards,
            and best practices and lessons learned to support our development and design
            process.</para>

            <title>Motivation for Safety Systems Thinking and HRO</title>
            <para>The health care system in the United States has undergone a digital transformation
                over the past few decades as digital health information systems and EHRs have been
                widely adopted and implemented. Despite this expansive transformation, elements of
                interoperability, data quality management, and the associated patient safety risks
                are underrepresented as key subject matter experts and informatics stakeholders have
                not been optimally involved in the design and implementation process of health
                information systems.</para>
            <para>The current state for health care knowledge management to ensure data quality and
                interoperability is to encode health data using medical terminology standards such
                as, LOINC®, SNOMED CT®, and RxNorm. These terminologies provide a standardized
                method to create and enter data elements into health care systems and, in an ideal
                world, support seamless interoperability between health care systems or health
                record systems. However, the application and use of these standards is typically not
                consistent during implementations between facilities within a health care system or
                between different systems. This non-standardized implementation leads to localized
                variants of terminologies and knowledge representations that limit interoperability
                and impacts opportunities to comprehensively understand data within a system.</para>
            <para>Not only is the current knowledge management unstandardized, but relative
                uncertainty also exists regarding the quality and accuracy of the data representing
                knowledge. A standardized process to validate the vast amount health care data does
                not exist. The current situation further impacts the quality and accuracy of data,
                the ability to support research and clinical decisions, and patient safety. Existing
                data validation techniques need to be standardized and refined to support
                comprehensive and reproducible validation of data within systems and transferable
                data between systems.</para>

            <title>Safety Systems Thinking and HRO Background</title>
            <para>Improving existing knowledge management constructs requires an understanding of
                industry leading frameworks and principles. Safety Systems Thinking and HRO
                principles are two frameworks that will support the development of a standardized
                and repeatable knowledge management and data validation process with continual
                improvement.</para>

                <title>Safety Systems Thinking Overview</title>
                <para>A systems thinking approach to safety is a thorough and disciplined approach
                    to identifying, analyzing, eliminating, and controlling hazards by analysis,
                    design, and management procedures that operate throughout a system’s life cycle.
                    Hazards are created by unsafe conditions and processes that may lead to negative
                    outcomes for stakeholders in the system, such as patients, providers, and
                    researchers.</para>
                <para>Traditional approaches to safety view hazards as a linear chain of events and
                    focus on eliminating component failures. However, a system thinking approach to
                    safety attempts to eliminate hazards by examining the various hierarchical
                    control structures and feedback loops that impact the conditions of a
                    system.</para>
                <para>In systems thinking, analysis of the system begins in the early concept design
                    stage and continually evaluates changes in the system or the environment that
                    could indicate a shift to unsafe conditions. Reporting and information sharing
                    channels are established, including hazard documentation, tracking, and
                    resolution. These documentation channels are critical to support continual
                    process improvement and are maintained throughout the lifespan of the
                    system.</para>

                an approach embedded in both Safety Systems Thinking and HRO principles can support
                major strides towards that goal. A combined approach will guide organizations
                through the successful implementation or redesign of systems to implement clear,
                concise, and standardized data validation techniques and support continuous process
                improvement through SME-led risk analysis and statistical, evidence-based review. </para>
            <para>It is not uncommon for other high-risk industries to adopt HRO principles.
                Commercial aviation and nuclear submarines are industries that adopted HRO based
                principles to enable substantial improvements to quality and safety. Pairing these
                principles with a systems-based approach to safety and proven tools like Statistical
                Process Control (SPC), Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA), and Causal
                Analysis based on System Theory (CAST) will further improve the safety,
                standardization, and quality of systems and knowledge management constructs.</para>
            <para>As we use systems thinking and HRO principles to develop and design a system that
                addresses the existing flaws in the current knowledge management constructs, it is
                critical that we perform a comprehensive and proactive assessment of the pertinent
                laboratory and health care systems, their controls, best practices, and weaknesses.

                <para>In this 2022 paper by Dr. Keith E. Campbell et al., the team outlines an
                    Independent Validation and Verification (IV&amp;V) approach that was designed
                    with system safety, HRO principles, and statistical process control techniques.
                    The generalized and iterative IV&amp;V sought to improve the quality and
                    interoperability of data through a three-phased approach, error discovery and
                    assessment, statistical process control, and continuous process

                    Artifacts Overview</title>
                <para>Greg Rehwoldt outlines a real-world use case of developing and applying a
                    risk-based methodology to improve the quality of current state knowledge
                    artifacts in this 2018 dissertation. [20] This paper highlights a variety of
                    issues with current state knowledge management, particularly the lack of
                    effective quality assurance for existing knowledge artifacts. Current approaches
                    to quality tend to focus on system specific events or stakeholder mistakes, but
                    as the health care environment has evolved, quality assurance must validate data
                    during creation and as it transitions between systems.</para>
                <para>While improving patient safety and data quality are key focuses of this paper,
                    financial theory is also applied to demonstrate how cost and time variables will
                    impact quality assurance. It is critical that data validation and assurance
                    methods are implemented optimally to reduce the risk of hazards or patient
                    safety issues while accounting for organizational constraints and pressures.

                researching existing laboratory and health care systems and terminology standards to
                build upon the years of research and SME experience.</para>
            <para>Our system will be designed with Safety Systems Thinking and HRO principles and
                will support the application of a rigorous and improved data review process that
                verifies and validates data at each step of information exchange for accuracy,
                completeness, and reliability. We must determine how to optimally design a system
                that ensures data from multiple medical terminology standards and EHRs maintains all
                relevant information and meaning as it seamlessly moves within and between systems.
