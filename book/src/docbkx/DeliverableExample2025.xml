        <para><anchor xml:id="Toc183349659"/>Scaling an open-source integrated knowledge management
            tool is essential to ensure it can effectively support growing user bases and knowledge
            data volumes, thereby improving knowledge sharing and interoperability. This document is
            an update to a previously submitted deliverable that serves as a summary of findings for
            best practices and potential methodologies to describe how the development of Integrated
            Knowledge Management (IKM) will be scaled to a large open-source community while
            maintaining functional integrity and encouraging new users to contribute within a shared
            authoring environment. As this effort progresses, these findings will evolve as we
            continue to understand the requirements, priorities, and needs of IKM and its
            users.</para>
