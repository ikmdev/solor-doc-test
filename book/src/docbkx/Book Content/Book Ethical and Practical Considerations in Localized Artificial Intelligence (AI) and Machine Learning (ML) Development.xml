            <title>Concerns About Localized AI/ML Models</title>
            <para>While localized development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
                (ML) offers customization and optimization benefits, the associated risks and
                challenges necessitate careful consideration. Without adequate safeguards and
                oversight, localized development can lead to biased, unreliable, and inequitable
                AI/ML algorithms, compromising patient care and outcomes. The concerns associated
                with localized development highlighted below document the need for a more
                standardized, equitable, and generalizable approach to developing AI/ML algorithms
                in healthcare.</para>
