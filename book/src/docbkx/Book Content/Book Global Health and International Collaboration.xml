        <title>IKM Relevance to Global Health and International Collaboration</title>
        <para>Before shifting our discussion to the topic of health and IKM collaboration at the
            global scale, the intention of this section is to take a moment to summarize our
            discussion at the national level before discussing various aspects of international
            collaboration. The previous parts of this work define the importance of IKM in
            healthcare to achieve coordinated and standardized ways to integrate healthcare data
            across systems. In addition, the volume series on <link xlink:href="http://ikm.dev"
                >IKM.dev</link> explore the course of data management in various service lines,
            highlighting emerging IT challenges and legal issues for maintaining and exchanging
            healthcare data. We can summarize the challenges we have discussed in two main areas: a
            challenge in the clinical setting and a challenge in the laboratory setting. </para>
        <para>In the clinical setting, Healthcare IT is intended to ease provider workload and
            ultimately improve patient care. However, the current inconsistencies can impact patient
            safety, provider efficiency, and other areas of patient care. For example, a patient’s
            primary care physician discovers a potentially pre-malignant mole on the patient’s back
            and flags it for follow up. When this patient moves across the country and receives care
            at a different healthcare system, the patient’s information is transferred to their new
            provider. Yet, this is where the “pre-malignant” description of the mole is lost because
            of a difference in the systems’ encoding standards. Neither the clinician nor the
            patient receives further signals to revisit the dermatologist for follow-up on the
            pre-malignant mole. The patient later presents with lower back pain and the mole is
            determined to be malignant and metastatic. Although the rapid development of healthcare
            IT has enabled organizations to transfer and exchange patient data at a more advanced
            level, the quality and accuracy of that transfer is impacted by the use of disparate
            terminology standards and differences between healthcare systems.</para>
        <para> In the laboratory setting, the goal has always been to move laboratory data through
            numerous systems while maintaining the data’s original structure and meaning. However,
            ever-increasing system complexity and reliance on low-quality data has ultimately
            decreased the quality of care across the healthcare ecosystem. While lab data is
            analyzed and transferred from the Laboratory Information System (LIS) to Provider EHRs
            to appropriate end users, much of the meaning of the original report is lost. Only 22 -
            26% of the single-trip data integrity is achieved, highlight the need for greater
            interoperability standards. [1]</para>
        <para>Efforts to standardize clinical terminology systems is often impacted by data siloes
            and incompatible Healthcare IT systems that make data difficult to exchange and
            interpret at a national level. [2] Health information specialists around the world noted
            the lack of interoperability standards between different systems during the COVID-19
            pandemic. Recently, we have seen a growing awareness and recognition of the need to
            standardize clinical terminology across the US and around the world. This chapter
            intends to explore various ongoing efforts to achieve interoperability at the
            international level, the current utilization of IKM in the areas of global health,
            on-going international collaborations, challenges, and potential opportunities for
            further international collaboration to improve the quality of healthcare around the
            world.</para>

        <title>Introduction </title>
        <para>Numerous international organizations have been established to collaborate on global
            health initiatives and to expand upon certain areas of focus, like public health. [3]
            This chapter will introduce the overall landscape of international healthcare
            organizations participating in global health, on-going efforts to achieve international
            interoperable digital health infrastructure, challenges with global interoperability,
            and potential solutions. Healthcare IT has been one of the rapidly growing areas that
            has gained further momentum following the COVID-19 global pandemic.</para>

        <title>Brief History of Global Health</title>
        <para>Global health originates from efforts to control infectious diseases and individual
            health through the delivery of healthcare to 16<superscript>th</superscript> and
                17<superscript>th</superscript> century European colonies. [4] Great Britain,
            France, and Portugal established colonies in India, China, Africa and elsewhere, where
            infectious diseases were devastating to both the native and European colonist
            populations. [5] Diseases spread rapidly, wiping out large portions of the population in
            the first years of colonization and giving birth to the field of Tropical Medicine. [6]
            Tropical Medicine bloomed throughout much of the 19<superscript>th</superscript> century
            and expanded to the field of public health with the development of military medicine and
            medical missions as more people traveled across the world. </para>
        <para>The formation of three organizations served as the precursor to forming a Health
            Committee under the League of Nations after World War II. [7] The International Sanitary
            Convention was formed in 1851 to create an international code for containing epidemics
            when a series of six cholera pandemics claimed the lives of thousands of tradesmen on
            the Silk Road between Rome and China. The Pan-American Sanitary Bureau was formed by the
            US and their trade partners in Central and South American in 1924, addressing the
            outbreak of yellow fever and starting the immigration health conversation. [8] The third
            group was the Rockefeller Foundation International Board of Health in 1913 as the single
            largest funder of global health in the early part of the 20<superscript>th</superscript>
            century, constructing public health schools in North America and Europe to train
            personnel to send to Latin America and the Caribbean to treat “tropical diseases”.
            [9]</para>
        <para>After World War II, the United Nations (UN) was formed and approved a constitution for
            the formation of the WHO that provided a wide range of aid to developing countries in
            the midst of the Cold War. After World War II, the creation and participation of
            Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
            the World Bank, increased to support re-building global infrastructure in the post-war
            era. [10] [11] </para>
        <para> Much of global health in the earlier years was shaped around tropical medicine and
            the public health work of overseas colonies. This trend was expanded to the work of
            medical missions and military medicine that provided a strong foundation for
            international collaboration in the latter half of the 21<superscript>st</superscript>
            century. [12] </para>

        <title>International Organizations Collaborating on Healthcare Information Technology
            (IT)</title>
        <para>The global trend of adopting computerized medical record systems was spearheaded by
            digital movements in the United States. In 2003, the Institute of Medicine, a division
            of the national Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine chose to coin the term,
                <emphasis role="italic">electronic health records</emphasis>, with the goal of
            computerizing medical records to improve safety and quality of patient-centered care. In
            2005, the World Health Assembly adopted the resolution WHA58.28 on electronic Health
            (eHealth) and urged Member States “to consider drawing up a long-term strategic plan for
            developing and implementing eHealth services… to develop the infrastructure for
            information and communication technologies for health … to promote equitable, affordable
            and universal access to their benefits.” [13] Passing this resolution encouraged more
            than 120 Member States, including low-and middle-income countries, to direct their
            efforts towards implementing eHealth to meet their country’s health priorities and
            resources through action-oriented steps. </para>
        <para>The U.S. federal government’s announcement of Health Information Technology for
            Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act in 2009 set aside $27 billion for an incentive
            program that encouraged hospitals and healthcare systems to adopt EHRs. [14] In 2010,
            WHO and SNOMED International initiated a formal collaborative relationship. SNOMED
            International and WHO began aligning their respective standards by enabling SNOMED CT®
            users to use WHO classifications, creating a joint and interoperable medical terminology
            system. [15] </para>
        <para>Additional United Nations Health Assembly sessions in 2013 and 2018 continued
            encouraging Member States to adopt eHealth strategies and identify priority areas,
            creating online public forums, providing technical consultations, and utilizing WHO
            regional committees to improve the global strategy on digital health. [16] </para>
        <para>Below is a list of several international organizations that have joined collective
            efforts to achieve standardization in a particular domain of healthcare and are actively
            collaborating with one another worldwide. While this list provides some key examples, it
            is not exhaustive and there are many other international organizations that contribute
            to standardizing clinical terminology or language in healthcare.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM)</title>
            <para>Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) provides the international
                standard for medical images and related information, defining formats for medical
                images that “can be exchanged with the data and quality necessary for clinical use”.
                [17] Established in 1993, DICOM has been an established name in cardiology imaging,
                radiology, dentistry, ophthalmology, and other medical service lines that involve
                any radiologic devices including X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound. DICOM drove efforts
                to replace X-ray film with digital images, eliminating industry waste and improving
                the transfer of high-quality images. [17] </para>
            <para>The initial open-source reference implementation of DICOM provided a crucial
                foundation for developers and healthcare entities to understand and utilize the
                DICOM standard. It offered developers, researchers, and manufacturers a free and
                practical example of DICOM functionality to ensure interoperability, validate the
                use of DICOM-compliant data, and encourage innovation and experimentation. The
                implementation included tools for encoding and decoding DICOM files, handling key
                DICOM services, implementing DICOM networking, and managing metadata. </para>
            <para>This approach fostered a collaborative environment, allowing global contributions
                and improvements, and served as a valuable learning resource for imaging device
                manufacturers, PACS developers, and healthcare software vendors. By providing a
                consistent and tested framework, it minimized discrepancies between different DICOM
                implementations and accelerated the standardization of medical imaging systems.
                Additionally, it acted as an educational tool, helping stakeholders understand DICOM
                objects, communication protocols, and service classes. Despite some limitations in
                scope, performance, and the ability to regularly update, the reference
                implementation inspired many popular open-source DICOM projects, such as DICOM
                Toolkit (DCMTK), Grassroots DICOM (GDCM), and Pydicom, which expanded on its
                concepts and features. This initial implementation was instrumental in the
                proliferation of the DICOM standard, paving the way for its widespread adoption as
                the de facto standard for medical imaging data management. Today, modern libraries
                and implementations continue to extend its impact, ensuring DICOM evolves to meet
                the complexities of modern healthcare workflows.</para>

            <title>Global Medical Device Nomenclature Agency (GMDN)</title>
            <para>When a medical device is developed, it needs to go through a number of regulatory
                approval steps. GMDN provides a standardized common language for all medical
                technology and collaborates with medical device regulators, manufacturers, and other
                relevant healthcare stakeholders to incorporate and develop established standards.
                Established in 1991 as the Global Harmonization Task Force that took over its
                precursor organization called the International Medical Device Regulatory Forum
                (IMDRF), GMDN helps accelerate and standardize medical device regulation globally
                with more than 70 national medical device regulators across more than 145 member

            <title>Challenges in global collaboration</title>
            <para>Many international organizations discuss the importance of interoperability and
                the dire need for connected and translatable systems to exchanges health data,
                scripts, and imaging in a standardized format. In this section, we discuss the
                challenges of interoperability in general and at the international level and
                potential solutions. </para>
            <para>The first challenge is the sheer amount and types of data that must be made
                interoperable. There is a wide range of data, disciplines, and file types in
                healthcare, all of which must be exchanged without losing structure or meaning. As
                demonstrated by the different terminology languages and respective organizations,
                there are a multitude of areas that require standardization, such as laboratory and
                pathology reports and images, diagnostic imaging reports, medication management,
                electronic prescriptions, patient access, and regulatory approval for medical
                devices. Determining the priority for which data to make interoperable first or
                which components would provide patients and providers with the greatest value add is
                a difficult question. [36] </para>
            <para>The next challenge is that efforts to improve interoperability require extensive
                research, trial and error, time, and resources to create a successful model. The
                desire to achieve interoperable EHRs or Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) has been
                around for a long time in many developed countries like the United States, Canada,
                and United Kingdom, but even in these developed countries, the existing EMR has a
                long way to go to achieve the data quality needed to provide safe patient care and
                improve provider satisfaction. [36] Even before discussing interoperability, rolling
                out EHRs can pose a challenge in many countries. </para>
            <para>Third, we need to provide a different approach for middle or low-income countries,
                instead of merely generalizing the implementation of IKM with the promise of
                unconditionally improving the quality of medical care. [36]. Some countries do not
                have the necessary medical professionals due to brain drain or the lack of medical
                infrastructures and cannot afford to have a separate pool of IT professionals or
                researchers in the field of medicine. International organizations need to assess
                different situations in different parts of the world, research every situation
                judiciously, and allocate appropriate IKM resources to provide impactful assistance. </para>
            <para>Fourth, not all nations in the world have the equal need for all interoperable
                systems or a-la-carte terminology systems in all service lines. [36] While some
                nations have a more need for the standardized clinical terminology in the field of
                tropical medicine, other nations have a more need for standardized cancer
                terminology and relevant interoperable system to exchange lab data and radiologic
                images. Achieving the global interoperability may neglect what’s most needed in a
                particular area of the world or at the scale of each continent. </para>
            <para>Finally, new technologies evolve more rapidly than ever before, bringing new legal
                and logistical challenges over data management, including emerging healthcare or
                well-being apps, telemedicine, and managing international patient data. [36] We need
                reliable international organizations that oversee these emerging interdisciplinary
                areas while identifying and developing standardization and technical tools for
                deployment around the world. </para>

            <para>According to the research survey conducted by the Global Digital Health
                Partnership, the following four top-three barriers in advancing the global
                interoperability were identified (Items 3 and 4 were tied): [36] </para>
            <orderedlist>

                    <para>EHRs lack the capability to take action based on exchanged data</para>

                    <para>Increasing cost due to interoperability that entities cannot afford
                    </para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
            <para>Most countries have systems that generate and communicate data to other providers
                but they lack the necessary functions to achieve truly interoperable data exchange
                and management. One area for the global effort to improve healthcare IT to focus on
                is recognizing the lack of EHR capabilities as the most important barrier to
                overcome. This barrier is directly tied to the “poor usability” barrier in cases
                where EHRs possess capabilities that are underused because adopting the new language
                takes significant training and time. [36] Redesigning clinical process is often an
                external quality improvement initiative in addition to implementing a good EHR
                system, adding more burden and disrupting the on-going flow within the existing EHR
                capability. </para>
            <para>Interoperability in healthcare is inherently more complex than in any other fields
                because achieving the purpose of interoperability involves multiple stakeholders on
                different sectors within healthcare and each of their agreement with the following
                stakeholders: payers, providers and pharmaceutical components. In addition,
                different countries operate on various models of healthcare insurance and network
                management that its own EHR system and interoperability planning need to scrutinize.
                Local, state, and federal regulations must cooperate with private and NGO
                institutions to solve these challenges. [36] </para>
