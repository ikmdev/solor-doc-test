    <title>Summary of Findings – Functional and Non-Functional Issues Related to Knowledge
        Management Proof of Concept</title>
    <section>
        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>Over the past year, our team has been working to develop an IKM reference
            implementation, Komet, to demonstrate IKM capabilities. Our work with Komet builds upon
            data property graph and RDF foundations and incorporates new concepts like versioned
            concept-oriented property graph representation. Due to the relatively novel nature of
            Komet and IKM, our team did not have guidelines or best practices to follow. Our initial
            work serves as a prototype that identifies functional and non-functional areas related
            to IKM that should be further explored. Throughout our experience, we have documented
            the following lessons learned, best practices, and challenges to improve the
            adoptability, functionality, and development of IKM as our team and other invested
            parties work towards future iterations.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Knowledge Management</title>
            <para>The team rapidly developed an IKM prototype leveraging the latest Tinkar data
                model standard to showcase IKM capabilities at the SNOMED CT® conference in October
                of 2023. Through the effort over the past year and leading up to that event, we’ve
                identified a few findings that have been resolved or will need to be resolved in the
                future.</para>
            <section>
                <title>Requirements</title>
                <para>As each clinical terminology standard has its own proprietary data
                    representation and tooling to both view and author data, the ability to
                    represent multiple standards with a common underlying data model and view or
                    author across standards in a single environment is an unprecedented idea. IKM
                    would influence a large community of users, such as hospitals, laboratories and
                    clinical informaticists so there are many thoughts and opinions about how IKM
                    should work and what features would be important. Though the potential
                    stakeholder base is large, the access to the community to illicit requirements
                    is very limited. While we were able to conduct user interviews during our User
                    Interface and User Experience (UI/UX) analysis to gain some understanding of
                    necessary system functionalities, we do have not regular access to those
                    participants. </para>
                <para>To solve for this, we’re leveraging experts to identify high priority
                    capabilities that will be prioritized for upcoming milestones. These milestones
                    will take shape in the form of conferences, community events, and other
                    demonstration opportunities. For example, we plan to organize a Health Level
                    Seven (HL7) Connect-a-thon event to conduct real-world testing scenarios with
                    interested invested parties.</para>
                <para>Leading up to the SNOMED CT® conference, we found that while we wanted to
                    support rapid development, we still needed a clear understanding of what system
                    capabilities were important to showcase for the demonstration and detailed
                    documentation in the form of user stories for the developers to reference. </para>
                <para>As seen in the figure below, we established a new process to describe the
                    system capabilities in the form of Agile epics and plot them against the
                    appropriate milestones to generate our product feature backlog. As per agile
                    development best practices, these epics are revisited weekly to be defined,
                    refined, and prioritized. These epics are then decomposed into user stories with
                    defined acceptance criteria for the development teams to develop against in
                    three week increments or sprints. [1]</para>

                <para>As the IKM community grows, we will leverage the open-source nature of the
                    project to track feature requests through submitted GitHub issues. [2] This
                    external issue tracker will be integrated more fully in the future but will
                    allow us to track feature requests against other priorities and communicated
                    releases back to the IKM community. [3]</para>

                <title>User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX) Design</title>
                <para>In early 2023, a UI/UX assessment for IKM was conducted to better understand
                    the needs and pain points of healthcare professionals in their daily operations
                    working with healthcare knowledge. The goal was to use findings from the
                    assessment to determine user profiles, requirements, and priority, which were
                    then used to strategize a human centered UI/UX design for a Next Gen IKM
                    platform that promotes data interoperability. </para>
                <para>The assessment was conducted in five phases:</para>

                            users.</para>

                </orderedlist>
                <para>Some of the challenges faced by the UI/UX team include representing different
                    knowledge standards with different requirements for viewing/editing in a
                    standardized way, abstracting complexities behind-the-scenes for an easier user
                    experience and designing in a way that supports iterative development while
                    still meeting future requirements.</para>
                <para>The team plans to tackle these challenges by identifying commonalities and
                    differences between user interfaces and data schema of existing knowledge
                    standards. The aim of these planned activities is to better understand how to
                    design a standard UI and conduct periodic user evaluation sessions for voluntary
                    user feedback within the healthcare industry. Healthcare parties can help the UI
                    community explore the latest design and share insightful information in the user
                    experience. They can also influence the process of building modular and
                    re-usable UI components that allow flexible and adaptable development in an
                    agile environment with changing requirements.</para>

                <title>Development and Operations (DevOps) Processes</title>
                <para>In the current state of Health IT, healthcare data standard organizations have
                    implemented restrictive licensing around their proprietary data and technology
                    which creates silos and the inability to collaborate across standards. IKM
                    provides an open-source solution that could be used across the community to
                    collaborate and further reduce these data silos. Komet is an open-source
                    solution in the form of an installed Java application that provides users the
                    ability to visualize, manage and extend disparate medical terminologies.
                    [4]</para>
                <para>Early in the development phase, we identified that we would need to make an
                    investment in Development and Operations (DevOps) technologies and tooling to
                    allow our open-source solutions to be rapidly developed and released to reach
                    the largest audiences possible. We began by hosting our DevOps tools, as it was
                    the quickest way to begin rapid prototyping. However, through this process,
                    we’ve found that the hosting of these tools requires more overhead and manhours
                    than we would like. Our larger goals and priorities require developers’ time to
                    contribute to our solutions rather than supporting our DevOps tools. We are
                    currently investigating and analyzing different alternative approaches to move
                    to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions for DevOps.</para>
                <para>Additionally, due to the licensing issues around proprietary data, as well as
                    other open-source technologies, we leverage both an internal and external code
                    repository. This arrangement allows us to continue development while we work
                    through licensing with the goal of becoming fully open-source. [5] Currently,
                    this complication keeps us from leveraging open-source supported tooling and
                    requires us to support complex DevOps processes to restrict the publishing of
                    code. Once these license issues are resolved, we’ll be able to leverage
                    additional tools to streamline and simplify our processes.</para>
                <para>However, our DevOps processes are largely successful as we’re able to
                    collaboratively develop across a large team and release both code and artifacts
                    to our public repository often and with little manual effort. Additionally,
                    every promotion to GitHub releases Windows, Mac and Linux versions of the Komet
                    installer to be available to the community for use.</para>

                <title>Data Layer Development</title>
                <para>As new knowledge standards are transformed and introduced to the Tinkar Core,
                    the more the need for ease of code troubleshooting and management becomes
                    apparent. [6] Reinforcing the code to also handle different types of data and
                    types of programming languages will also keep the data ingestion and export free
                    of conflicts. Additionally, adding in a layer of abstraction is needed to allow
                    all types of users to set up and use Komet. For large scale development and
                    automation to be possible these improvements to code and architecture will be
                    crucial. </para>

            <section>
                <title>Bindings</title>
                <para>Currently, Tinkar Core uses Tinkar Terms to call certain Java variables that
                    represent retrievable concepts from the Tinkar datastore. As the codebase
                    develops and changes, these can be difficult to maintain, especially when more
                    complexity is added. Each Tinkar Term affected must be manually identified and
                    changed if needed. Not only is it time consuming, but it can be susceptible to
                    human error. By creating an automated solution like a bindings library, updates
                    will be made efficiently and can be integrated into a dependency management
                    system. </para>

            <section>
                <title>Protocol Buffers</title>
                <para>With the requirement of being able to support many types of information
                    systems, the ingestion of data requires a programming language neutral format.
                    Protocol buffers solve this issue, by serializing the structure data with a
                    format that supports many programming languages. Additionally, it is open-source
                    code and does not require a licensing to implement. This would allow the data to
                    be exported in easy to share formats that can be simply shared and imported.
                </para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Data Retrieval and Curation</title>
                <para>As the Komet users increase, adoption of the tool will need to accommodate a
                    variety of experienced users. Currently, the Tinkar database requires a
                    significant amount of coding and or prior knowledge of lower-level data
                    structures to successfully retrieve and manipulate Tinkar data elements. This
                    inevitably limits the immediate number of users who can implement meaningful
                    solutions using Komet and the Tinkar data. Creating an abstraction layer and or
                    user experience that allows users to have an easier and streamlined approach
                    working with and updating Tinkar data will result in users utilizing the Komet
                    to its full potential. </para>

            <title>Solution Adoption</title>
            <para>To date, the IKM Solution Adoption team has worked to identify key invested
                parties and tailor content to their understanding of the goals of IKM. In this phase
                of increasing awareness, the team has developed and disseminated informational
                presentations and trainings both internally and externally to federal and industry
                partners. Through this and additional presentations and demos of Komet at industry
                conferences (i.e., SNOMED International Expo, American Medical Informatics
                Association), the team has been able to identify champions for the IKM movement
                across the ecosystem. As awareness has increased, the team has been able to maintain
                stakeholder relationships through personalized communications to individual invested
                parties at organizations of significance (i.e. Food and Drug Administration, Office
                of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, Graphite Health,
                Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia).</para>
            <para>Through such engagements, the team has recognized the following key findings of
                developing successful communications that will propel the efforts up the
                communications curve trajectory. </para>
            <section>
                <title>Curating Technical Communications</title>
                <para>There is a need in IKM communications to provide adequate technical guidance
                    for invested parties interested in collaboration and/or integration. Therefore,
                    the development of proper processes and documentation of work has been critical
                    to the IKM strategic communications efforts and will continue to be strengthened
                    as we move towards driving engagement.</para>

                <title>Defining IKM</title>
                <para>IKM is an evolving and novel movement in the healthcare information technology
                    field. Therefore, communicating to all potential invested parties effectively on
                    the mission to increase cohesion in health data standards and what problems that
                    it may solve is paramount to advancing the movement. Based on feedback from
                    stakeholder engagement sessions, the team has been iteratively refining
                    strategic communications initiatives to develop concise and aimed messaging to
                    key invested parties.</para>

                <title>Ensuring End User Adoption</title>
                <para>A more nuanced challenge that the IKM movement faces as technologies and
                    integration methods develop into end-user capabilities is the adoption and
                    implementation of these tools by the end-users themselves, whether they are
                    clinicians, healthcare organizations, laboratories, or other healthcare-related
                    entities. Many of these end-users may not have the technical background or
                    insight into the issues that IKM addresses and aims to solve and therefore may
                    not fully be invested in adopting such a solution into their operations. </para>
                <para>As future efforts in the Integrated Knowledge Management space are advanced,
                    there will be an increased need for intentional strategies centered around
                    communications to the various invested parties that IKM impacts to ensure
                    engagement and ultimate adoption. Technical professionals in the data standards
                    field will need to have transparent and detailed information on the
                    methodologies used in previous efforts in order to continuously improve upon the
                    collaborative process. Further, end-user specific communication plans will be
                    developed that articulate both the problems that IKM attempts to solve along
                    with a clear explanation about the tools’ capabilities. </para>

            <title>Knowledge Representation</title>
            <para>The advantages of utilizing a generalized, self-describing data structure are
                well-documented. This data structure comprises not just the database but also
                includes metadata that outlines and explains both the data and the connections
                between tables [7]. Also, descriptions of data structures and constraints are
                included, allowing storage of a description of its own structure within the
                database. While this self-describing approach is reference terminology-agnostic,
                making it capable of accommodating various data sources, challenges for determining
                the importance of terminology-specific data components are introduced [8].</para>
            <para>Representing data properties such as concepts, patterns, or semantics becomes a
                complex task, especially when importing data from multiple terminology standards. As
                clinical reference terminologies, SNOMED CT® and LOINC® employ different data
                structures to represent their respective content. These data structures do not
                translate easily between terminologies. SNOMED CT® utilizes Concepts, Descriptions,
                and Relationships, organized hierarchically to convey clinical meanings to its
                terms. LOINC® codes are represented by five or six main parts. And hierarchical
                relationship between LOINC® terms is manually applied outside of the LOINC® SNOMED
                CT® Collaboration. The components from each of these terminologies may function as
                crucial data structure components for axioms and related data properties within the
                database. [9]</para>
            <para>Once imported into a self-describing data structure, determining equivalence with
                another terminology standard or which parts of the data components are important may
                create unanticipated challenges [7]. Unlike more specific terminology models, Tinkar
                lacks pre-defined references to identify crucial components or properties within
                incoming data, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of the dataset. This
                challenge extends to determining the importance or equivalence of specific data
                components, prompting the creation of new properties and concepts before the data
                can be seamlessly imported into Tinkar. While the generic nature of Tinkar provides
                valuable flexibility for accommodating diverse data standards, it underscores the
                need for a proactive and nuanced approach to customization. This adaptability allows
                Tinkar to serve as a versatile platform capable of handling a variety of data
                sources, but it also highlights the importance of thoughtful customization to ensure
                effective integration. [6]</para>
