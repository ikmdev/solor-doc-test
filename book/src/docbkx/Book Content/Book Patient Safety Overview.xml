    <title>Patient Safety Overview</title>
    <para>IKM is a set of principles, tools and methods that are designed to make doing the right
        thing easier. One of those “right things” is patient safety. First and foremost, our health
        information must do no harm to the patient. IKM enables more accurate, complete, precise,
        and higher-quality health data that is safer to use for clinical decision-making as
        low-quality health data management practices can lead to under treatment, over treatment, or
        delayed treatment resulting in preventable patient harm. [16]</para>
    <section>
        <title>Patient Safety – Then and Now</title>
        <para>Patient safety has been defined as the “prevention of harm to patients.” [17] To
            achieve patient safety, the whole healthcare system must work collaboratively to prevent
            errors, learn from the errors that occur, and develop a culture of safety similar to
            other high-risk industries, such as aviation.</para>
        <para>Previously, patient safety efforts have primarily focused on investigating adverse
            events <emphasis role="italic">after</emphasis> they have occurred. This is known as
                <emphasis role="bold">reactive safety</emphasis> and, while important for learning
            from errors, is insufficient in reducing common adverse events. such as medication
            errors, surgical complications, or diagnostic errors. [17] Alternatively, <emphasis
                role="bold">proactive safety</emphasis> attempts to design or redesign systems,
            processes, and methods based on leading indicators of increased risk, poor quality, or
            identified flaws <emphasis role="italic">before</emphasis> an adverse event occurs.
            Examples of proactive safety practices include hazard analysis, safety reporting,
            audits, tracers, training, testing, and surveys to measure the culture of safety.</para>
        <para>Properly implementing both reactive and proactive safety requires organizations and
            systems to develop a <emphasis role="bold">culture of safety</emphasis> that establishes
            a non-punitive response to error, also known as a “just culture". Just culture is a
            balance between learning from error and accountability that encourages practitioners to
            be transparent with the self-reporting of errors by reducing or eliminating the fear of
            retribution, loss of employment, or legal action. [18] Blaming an individual or team for
            system errors prevents learning from errors, impedes continuous improvement, and
            reinforces silence when system vulnerabilities are discovered. Unfortunately, many
            current healthcare professionals continue to be hesitant when reporting errors due to
            medical malpractice litigation concerns and threat of employment termination.</para>
        <para>Since the 1999 report, <emphasis role="italic">To Err is Human</emphasis>, was
            published by the Institute of Medicine, patient safety has received more attention
            across the healthcare ecosystem due to the prevalence of preventable patient harm.

            <title>High Reliability Organizations (HROs)</title>
            <para>High reliability organization (HRO) principles from other safety critical
                industries, such as commercial aviation and nuclear power, began to be adopted as a
                patient safety framework in some healthcare settings. [25] These principles,
                outlined in the table below, originated from social science as behaviors present in
                organizations that operate in extremely complex, high-risk environments with high
                levels of system reliability believed to produce safer outcomes. Reliability is the
                probability that a component or system will perform as designed under certain
                conditions over time (i.e., checklists). </para>

            <para>While leaders and managers can foster a culture supported by HRO principles, HRO
                methods rely on decomposition or breaking complex systems down into single
                components to analyze. If they primarily focus on reducing errors at a single
                component level, also known as component failures (human or machine), they can be
                erroneously made to believe that worse case scenarios (losses, adverse events, and
                accidents) have linear causality with the human as a possible weak link in the
                system.</para>
            <para>Traditional safety approaches are inadequate when it comes to addressing the
                increasing complexity in the healthcare ecosystem. Methodologies, like root cause
                analysis (RCA) and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), focus on failures at a
                component level or as over-simplified human error and were developed before work
                systems incorporated software, computers, and other sophisticated technology such as
                artificial intelligence (AI). The healthcare ecosystem is complex, multifaceted, and
                highly coupled across various systems, such as healthcare data information systems,
                and requires a more complex and comprehensive approach to safety that employs
                systems theory, systems thinking, and a systems approach to safety. [26,27]</para>

            <title>System Safety</title>
            <para>System Safety is rooted in systems theory where the whole system is more than the
                sum of the parts. System Safety addresses the whole using a combination of systems
                and safety engineering approaches and views patient safety as a control problem. </para>
            <para>Engineering models can be developed and analyzed for safety and quality purposes
                throughout the system’s lifecycle from design through adoption. These system models
                are <emphasis role="italic">not</emphasis> schematics or flow charts; instead, they
                serve as abstract representations of highly complex sociotechnical relationships
                between a controller and the process being controlled. These relationships are known
                as control loops, which is displayed below. [28]</para>

            <para>Control loops are hierarchal with the <emphasis role="italic">Provider</emphasis>
                as a controller above the <emphasis role="italic">Patient</emphasis>, the controlled
                process in this example. The downward arrows represent the control actions that the
                controller uses to control the patient care process including assessments, exams,
                tests, imaging, treatments, and therapies. The upward arrows are feedback mechanisms
                the provider receives from the patient such as their medical history, symptoms, and
                health trends. </para>
            <para>Without adequate feedback, the provider would not be able to make safe, high
                quality clinical decisions that meet the standard of care. The <emphasis
                    role="italic">Provider</emphasis> controller develops a process model or belief
                system about each individual patient before making treatment decisions. Other
                information may be accessible through the patient’s electronic health record (EHR),
                a family member, or another patient advocate. Modelling the patient care system of
                interest builds on this control loop to include other essential control loops
                forming what’s known as a control structure. [29]</para>
            <para>Once the control structure is fully modelled, either in the design or redesign
                phases of the system lifecycle, teams can conduct proactive and retrospective safety
                analyses to identify new requirements, system hazards, unsafe control actions, and
                missing feedback loops. The System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) method is most
                effective when used early in the design or redesign phase as a prospective safety
                analysis while the Causal Analysis based on Systems Theory (CAST) is used
                retrospectively to determine causal factors of adverse events such as preventable
                patient harm. [30]</para>

            <title>Safety Management</title>
            <para>Safety Management Systems (SMS)are used by high-risk industries such as aviation,
                military commands, health care, and nuclear power to reduce or eliminate hazards for
                safer outcomes. SMS is a formalized approach to safety decision-making, proactive
                safety management, safety culture promotion, and quality assurance. An effective SMS
                relies on a comprehensive safety information system that has leading indicators of
                safe performance, feedback from voluntary reporting, and passive data collection
                using software applications that monitor system control actions. </para>
            <para>Safety data trends are reported to responsible parties including operators,
                supervisors, management, regulators, and other industry stakeholders. An SMS is an
                enabler for learning including knowledge sharing, policy effectiveness, and
                innovation and drives key processes like safety risk management and safety
                assurance. [31] SMS design is enhanced when system control structures are modelled,
                monitored, and audited using system safety engineering principles such as STPA to
                support continual process improvement.</para>
            <para>Safety in a health data context includes clinical decision support, safe data
                exchange, and safe use of health data for regulatory oversight, health equity,
                research, and population health decision-making. Furthermore, poor data quality
                degrades patient safety especially among disparate health populations when using low
                quality data to train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for patient care.

            <title>The Promise of Digital Health Information and Patient Safety</title>
            <para>Moving from paper charts to EHR systems is mostly complete (96%) in hospitals in
                the U.S., while 22% of office-based physician practices remain paper-based. [33]
                Incentive programs such as the <emphasis role="italic">Meaningful Use
                </emphasis>(MU) program provided government funding through the U.S. Center for
                Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for health systems and provider organizations
                to digitize their health information systems. From 2010-2020, MU program goals
                included digital data collection, data sharing, advanced clinical processes, and
                improved outcomes. Studies have shown that HIT has improved patient safety by
                reducing medication errors, avoiding adverse drug reactions, and increasing
                adherence to evidence-based medicine protocols. [34]</para>
            <para>While HIT has improved some clinical outcomes, the adoption, configuration,
                implementation, and maintenance of HIT has increased patient risk in other parts of
                the health delivery system due to unintended consequences of poorly managed systems.
                [35] First-generation HIT configurations have mostly been managed by HIT vendors who
                mainly focused on billing data and other administrative and operational data
                management functions (e.g., reimbursement, mandatory reporting, etc.). HIT adoption
                radically changed historic clinical workflows in an effort to standardize data
                inputs and system outputs, but this “one size fits all” approach was resisted by
                clinicians creating configuration trade-offs, workarounds, and increased system
                complexity. </para>
            <para>Local configurations and local coding created unique HIT features and
                functionality, which may have been needed based on hospital location or patient
                population, also created variability from hospital to hospital even within the same
                health network. For the most part, these local variations had few <emphasis
                    role="italic">visible</emphasis> negative consequences for patients and health
                practitioners. Unfortunately, most HIT configurations did not optimize for patient
                mobility – patients who received care in non-affiliated systems or for the need to
                share precise data with other health systems, health registries, and public health
                agencies.</para>
            <para>Without new incentives, many organizations are unable to fully maintain their HIT
                as vendor maintenance contract costs continue to increase. Experienced HIT personnel
                have also become more expensive as technology companies search for qualified staff
                in a decreasing talent pool, which has led Health systems to be more dependent on
                vendors to fill the talent gap. Some under-resourced hospitals may be forced to
                delay system upgrades and updates – even important changes in terminology, clinical
                workflows, naming and coding, or other critical data quality enhancements due to
                concerns over system failures, outages, or unexpected consequences from system
                updates. These are real concerns and may lead to patient safety implications. The
                recent CrowdStrike cybersecurity update failure in 2024 caused many health systems
                to cancel surgeries and other non-critical services leading to over $2 billion in
                losses to healthcare organizations. [36]</para>
            <section>
                <title>Addressing Patient Safety Gaps in the Current Health Data Ecosystem</title>
                <para>Health data is a critical component of health care decisions and can directly
                    impact the treatment that patients receive, and the quality of care delivered.
                    Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) depend on accurate and precise data to
                    ensure decision “triggers” fire when appropriate to prevent delays in treatment
                    or diagnostic errors. If important clinical information is missing sufficient
                    context, decision-making can be incorrect, insufficient, or incomplete. A
                    laboratory test result that is missing units of measure, reference range, or
                    unique device identification may be excluded from a providers decision-making
                    process for a patient, which may then prompt further testing, additional costs,
                    and unnecessary patient suffering through intrusive tests. Patient history may
                    not always be accurate or complete – especially when limiting data migration to
                    a patient’s recent history or when sharing data from one EHR to another.</para>
                <para>Many of the errors related to encoding, sharing, and exchanging health data
                    remain difficult to manage safely since institutions are mostly interested in
                    the quality of the data received rather than the data sent. ASTP/ONC has
                    developed the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) to enhance
                    data sharing and data exchange by establishing policies, governance practices,
                    and standards aimed at making health data more accessible for payers, public
                    health agencies, provider organizations, and patients. TEFCA will likely enhance
                    the data sharing infrastructure, but it still does not currently address the
                    quality of data being shared. [37]</para>
                <para>Data intended to be used for research needs to possess the attributes
                    summarized in the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability
                    (FAIR) Guiding Principles, which provide guidelines to make data findable (F),
                    accessible (A), interoperable (I), and reusable (R) to the research community
                    and machines. Unfortunately, a large portion of health data does not meet the
                    FAIR Guiding Principles as it is often hidden in isolated data silos or
                    incompatible systems and difficult to exchange, process, and interpret. [38,39]
                    During the COVID-19 pandemic, leaders were unable to make informed decisions
                    related to public health because of incomplete data, unstructured data, and
                    missing data leading to preventable patient deaths, pandemic response delays,
                    and unnecessary lockdowns. [40]</para>

            <para>Many other safety-critical industries are addressing the data quality of their safety
                information to improve safety management of their aircraft, automobiles, power plants,
                and search engines. In today’s digital healthcare ecosystem and with patients receiving
                care in diverse health settings, even at home, patient safety does not just depend upon
                highly skilled clinicians. Now, more than ever, patient safety depends on high quality
                data. Producing high quality data depends on ensuring data is accurately encoded at the
                source and exchanged or migrated without losing meaningful context for clinical decision
                making no matter where a patient receives treatment. Health informaticists and HIT
                professionals need tooling and support to ensure their organizations are producing high
