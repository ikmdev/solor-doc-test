        <title>Use Case: Komet Application</title>
        <para>This section outlines three key components of the Knowledge Management Environment
            (Komet) application, Terminology Knowledge Architecture (Tinkar) knowledge architecture,
            and open-source contributions.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Komet Use Case – Rapid Knowledge Management</title>
            <para>A primary benefit of Komet and the Tinkar architecture used to manage integrated
                knowledge is the ability to rapidly update integrated knowledge in accordance with
                emerging or needed concepts and to address irregularities or errors. </para>
            <para>Komet is capable of not only identifying errors but also resolving them. For
                example, if you searched for “chronic lung disease” and opened the “Chronic lung
                disease (disorder)” that takes an user to the concept navigator. The user may notice
                that this concept only displays two children concepts, which seems incomplete as
                there should be many more children concepts for such a broad disorder. To explore
                and understand why this potential error is occurring, the user then could click on
                both the ‘Properties’ and ‘Timeline’ buttons to open additional information about
                the “Chronic lung disease (disorder)” concept. In the ‘Properties’ frame, the user
                could select ‘Hierarchy’ and turn the ‘Range’ option on in the Timeline frame. Doing
                so will display how the concept has changed over time, additions to concepts, and
                allows users to compare select versions of a concept.</para>
            <para>While a user may see version history, there is still no information on why there
                are only two children concepts. The user can then go back to the concept navigator
                and edit the EL++ Axiom from ‘Necessary Set’ to ‘Sufficient Set’, select reasoner,
                and run the ‘ELK Reasoner’. This then shows the recent edit and update, which shows
                the increased number of children concepts to over
                20.<?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?></para><?oxy_custom_end?>
            <para>While Komet, Tinkar, and our open-source approach allow the user to identify an
                error by navigating the site, understanding the concept versioning and history,
                making edits to resolve the issue in real-time, and committing the changes to the
                community at large, other Terminology Standards lack in coordinating this rapid
                approach. If an user identified this error and submitted it to Systemized
                Nomenclature of Medicine – Clinical Terms® (SNOMED CT®), they might have to wait a
                full six months before SNOMED CT® pushed their bi-annual updates and might be forced
                to employ sub-optimal work arounds to address the issue until then. This real-time
                approach of managing integrated knowledge management also allows the creation of
                concepts, such as SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), to meet emerging conditions and clinical
                needs.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Komet Use Case – Integration of Terminology Standards</title>
            <para>Another fundamental component of Komet is the integration of various terminology
                standards. When searching “urine homocysteine measurement”, a user can see the
                SNOMED CT® concept ‘Urine Homocysteine Measurement (procedure)’ in the navigation
                panel, while simultaneously viewing Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Code®
                (LOINC®) children concepts. Komet can seamlessly integrate concepts from different
                terminology standards and identify which concepts are associated by using a
                localized common language in the form of Analysis Normal Form (ANF).</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Komet Use Case – Detecting Equivalent Concepts</title>
            <para>Komet is also able to easily and clearly identify concepts that are equivalent and
                display any minor differences between them. If an user were to search for a concept
                to describe ankylosis in the left and right knees, they would be presented with
                ‘Observation of ankylosis of both knee joints (procedure)’ and ‘Ankylosis of
                bilateral knee joints (disorder)’. By running the Komet reasoner, selecting detect
                equivalencies, right clicking these two concepts, and selecting ‘Compare Concepts’,
                a user could determine that these concepts are equivalent. A user could then do a
                deep-dive into the concept axioms using a side-by-side comparison to understand if
                there were any minute differences between the two.</para>

        <title>Use Case: Considerations for Real World Data Interoperability and Data Agility in
            Patient Journey to Diagnosis for Emerging Acute and Chronic Infectious Diseases</title>
        <section>
            <title>Introduction to the Emerging Acute and Chronic Infectious Diseases Use
                Case</title>
            <para>Increased generation of real-world data (RWD) and real-world evidence (RWE) from
                personal health devices, electronic heath records (EHR), and other sources has
                fueled a new wave of advanced analytics and has proven to be critical when
                evaluating emerging health trends. [1] Digital health devices, over-the-counter
                (OTC) diagnostic tests, and other technologies are important sources of RWD and can
                be used as decision support tools. However, interoperability issues including
                challenges with data transmission, storage, retrieval, and aggregation must be
                addressed to support safe and effective use of the data. RWE can drive important
                insights into public health and predict emerging diseases, pandemics such as
                COVID-19, and other population health trends. Timely access to interoperable data is
                critical when developing guidance and improving patient care and outcomes. </para>
            <para>Clinical workflows are highly cited as rich sources for analysis of clinical
                decision-making support and process improvement. Clinical process modeling and
                workflows can be used to understand a clinician’s reasoning, understanding, and use
                of patient data. Workflows capture the thought process behind decision making, help
                visualize the process, and can be considered as a decision tree. [2] Certain
                workflows can be used to understand the clinical data life cycle. In Vankipuram et
                al., the authors use a clinical workflow analytics framework using radio-frequency
                identification (RFID) to identify three phases of data flow: transmission, analysis,
                and transformation. [3] In these studies, the authors highlight the benefits and
                potential use of analyzing workflows to improve patient care or enhance clinical
                decision support tools. Other workflow analyses incorporate predictive modeling to
                analyze and predict most efficient operating models that drive effective
                interventions. [4] Advanced analytics including artificial intelligence and other
                technologies are being explored in workflows. [5] However, advanced analytical
                outcomes are fully dependent on the data feeding into the system. </para>
            <para>Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN) is a diagram technique used to
                represent a flowchart of activities and decision processes and is beneficial to
                healthcare organizations seeking to implement process improvements. BPMN is a tool
                organizations use to evaluate clinical decision support systems, model clinical
                treatment protocols, and easily relay complex processes. BPMN is often used to model
                organizational or task related processes, but its use can be broadened to understand
                systemic flows of information. [6-8] As Kassim et al. point out in their systematic
                review, most BPMN focuses on clinical decision support but stops short of modeling
                patient healthcare trajectories and, with that, health information. [9]</para>
            <para>Existing approaches of clinical process modeling analyze the data but fail to
                explore data considerations such as data capture and transmission. The need for
                interoperable data is evident. In previous health emergencies, important sources of
                data were identified too late, and the use of those data was further delayed by
                incompatibilities in interoperability. Preparing federal agencies and public health
                authorities with RWE tools will facilitate early identification of potential
                pandemics and diseases and allow timely and well-informed decision making. To reach
                this level of preparedness, it is critical to understand where potential data are
                generated, stored, and transmitted in a clinical workflow.</para>

            <title>Aims for the Emerging Acute and Chronic Infectious Diseases Use Case</title>
            <para>In this body of work, we aim to demonstrate the importance of an interoperable
                data system and downstream analytical scenarios through a use case for Long COVID.
                We propose that the methods and findings are not solely applicable to a use case for
                Long COVID and are reproducible for any emerging acute and chronic infectious
                disease use case. This use case presents a Long COVID workflow highlighting a
                patient’s journey from first onset of COVID-19 symptoms through a Long COVID
                diagnosis and describes how data are captured, transmitted, and aggregated in a way
                that can be generalized to other emerging acute and chronic infectious diseases.
                Through understanding of data generation, transmission, and analysis we can identify
                important information and trends and establish an ideal future state for the use of
                RWE. </para>

            <title>Emerging Acute and Chronic Infectious Diseases Use Case Background</title>
            <para>The COVID-19 pandemic drastically impacted healthcare, laboratory operations,
                pharmaceuticals, and patient care delivery. While extensive resources have been
                allocated to studying COVID-19 in support of vaccine development, public health
                policies, and treatment, the long-term symptoms and impacts of COVID-19 are not well
                known. Long COVID is a poorly understood condition associated with lasting health
                problems that persist past the typical symptomatic period after an initial COVID-19
                infection. While Long COVID is typically marked by longitudinal fatigue, respiratory
                issues, and brain fog, there is a growing pool of symptoms and complications. Health
                conditions, duration, and even test results can vary across Long COVID cases,
                leading to an inability to quickly diagnose Long COVID. Identifying Long COVID is
                further complicated by a variety of inaccurate, lost, or suboptimal data collection
                and reporting. Due to these difficulties, there is no diagnostic test available for
                Long COVID, and care providers often reach a Long COVID diagnosis by ruling out
                other diseases or disorders with similar symptoms. [10-14]

SHIELD is a public-private collaboration focused on improving interoperability of in vitro diagnostic data between institutions.

                COVID is a poorly understood sequela to a COVID infection. In general, it is
                characterized by a wide range of ongoing health symptoms lasting weeks or months
                following a COVID infection, including fatigue, post-exertional malaise, fever,
                respiratory symptoms, neurological effects, and more. Even the CDC’s definition
                notes that the symptom list is not comprehensive and that post-COVID conditions may
                vary in symptom type, effect, and timespan, demonstrating how incomplete our medical
                understanding remains. [1] The NIH has stood up the Researching COVID to Enhance
                Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, allocating $1.15 billion to better understand the
                development and symptoms of long COVID. [2] Similarly, the U.K. has invested over
                £50 million into long COVID research initiatives. [3] Countless other countries and
                research institutions are doing the same as evidence mounts demonstrating the
                significant public health risk of this largely undefined
                condition.<?oxy_comment_end?></para>
            <para><?oxy_comment_start author="rgeorgacopoulos" timestamp="20240712T170727-0500" comment="This is from SoF-RWE Search and Query Methods "?>Our
                incomplete understanding of long COVID is akin to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus
                (HIV) / Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s
                where the differentiation between HIV and AIDS was not yet known. Only after
                substantial research brought the proper discovery and understanding of HIV infection
                and AIDS, effective treatments and secondary preventative treatments developed. [4]
                Likewise, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (RD) were once considered
                syndromic; that is, poorly understood and only clinically characterized. After
                further research, we now recognize Alzheimer’s as a biologically diagnosed condition
                - a definitive diagnosis that is determined postmortem only. [5]</para>
            <para>The use of RWD resources has shown promise for hard-to-diagnose conditions. For
                example, Rheumatoid Arthritis related interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) is a
                difficult diagnosis often only diagnosed reliably by rheumatologists in conjunction
                with substantial diagnostic work-up. However, studies at the VA and UNMC PCORnet and
                VA datasets demonstrate that commonly discrete data elements in the EHR can be used
                to identify RA-ILD patients based on their data phenotype. With the addition of
                low-level, basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) for radiology report evaluations,
                high levels of Positive Predictive Value (PPV) identification of RA-ILD patient by
                data phenotype is possible.</para>
            <para>To address the long COVID use case, the FDA must have access to substantial
                amounts of data for patients positively diagnosed for COVID, for patients who
                exhibit identified long COVID symptoms (with and without a positive COVID
                diagnosis), and patients who have had no known COVID infection(s) and do not exhibit
                long COVID symptoms. These data need to be complete and have all appropriate data
                elements coded with standard values to enable meaning to be determined across
                facilities. Complete, standardized patient data across time and facilities will
                allow researchers to access symptoms, existing morbidities, demographics (including
                weight and age), treatments taken (for COVID or other conditions), vaccinations
                received, screening and diagnostic test data, and potentially other information like
                drug use, alcohol use, and smoking. This will enable the use of statistical methods
                and advanced analytics to quickly determine the relevant data elements and values
                necessary to more accurately establish a clinical definition for diagnosing an
                emerging condition like long COVID, along with identifying risk factors for
                contracting it, and provide evidence to develop tests and drugs for confirming and
                treating the condition. </para>
            <para>In addition to “validated” data, such as existing laboratory and other diagnostic
                test data, provider-level patient reports and physician interpretation data must be
                collected. Furthermore, patient-reported, non-physician translated data should be
                considered, collected, and incorporated with the more clinically oriented data.
                Existing RWD ecosystems could add value to long COVID research. For example, the
                Sentinel system, which collects large quantities of claims records, could assist in
                identifying patient cohorts or determining secondary variables that may indicate
                long COVID symptoms. However, the known limitations of systems like Sentinel must be
                considered, such as potential incompleteness, poor association to actual patient
                outcomes, or diagnosis oversimplification within billing applications. </para>
            <para>There are several conditions that must be considered to effectively address
                misunderstood conditions like long COVID with RWD. Though it may be incomplete,
                there needs to be a baseline description of the condition to identify variables and
                data sources of interest. This definition may be treated as fluid and updated as
                research progresses, so there must be adequate agility to evaluate, collect, and
                integrate new data elements inclusive of existing health care as well as novel
                observations. As with all varied data collections, an emphasis on standardization
                and normalization is key to achieve interoperability. In the capture process,
                non-discrete data will need to be harvested and converted to discrete data.
                Effective analysis will rely on the ability to query the data in multiple ways with
                multiple parameters, both within and across care sites.</para>
            <para>As long COVID continues to grow as a public health priority, a proactive RWD
                research approach could provide valuable insights into the condition that may be
                difficult to discern through other research methods. To effectively understand and
                treat long COVID and other poorly understood diseases, researchers must be able to
                differentiate case and control patients with high reliability to then test the
                efficacy and safety of new diagnostic and treatment options. RWD may have
                considerable potential in clearly identifying patient cohorts to advance
                understanding of the disease and develop effective treatments. </para><?oxy_comment_end?>
            <para>This Long COVID use case helps advance our understanding of the health data
                ecosystem and the necessary data capture and agility to ensure safe and effective
                patient care. This workflow broadly represents and can be applied to other emerging
                acute and chronic infectious diseases in that it highlights the data gaps and
                opportunities for use of RWE. We propose a future state workflow and proactive
                approach where data sets are analyzed and signals are detected before a condition is
                known, thereby yielding health information systems that are safe, effective, and

                <title>Aim 1: Document a Current State Long COVID Workflow Depicting Data Loss </title>
                <para>The team developed the generalized Long COVID workflow depicted in Figure 1
                    highlighting the steps a patient takes throughout their diagnostic journey with
                    accompanying data generated at each step. The team gathered foundational Long
                    COVID research to establish a comprehensive list of widely accepted and
                    important data elements and data entry points for the workflow. [10-13] A
                    template form was created to gather input from the team members on these data
                    elements including actors, descriptions, triggers, pre and post conditions,
                    assumptions, and data fields, and eight team members independently documented
                    considerations in the workflow. Team members had varying professional
                    backgrounds including MD, NP, RN, Informaticist, Terminologists, Health Level
                    Seven International (HL7) Interface Engineers, Public Health, and Systems
                    Engineering. The team met to discuss the exercise and highlight differing
                    approaches in the team’s documentation and considerations. Common themes were
                    extracted and used in Visio to develop an initial draft of a generalized Long
                    COVID use case workflow schematic that was iterated upon based on subject matter
                    expert and key stakeholder input. The workflow follows an inpatient and
                    outpatient path and identifies common steps in a patient’s diagnostic journey
                    along with associated data to highlight opportunities for more accurate and
                    comprehensive data collection. Several important data elements were identified
                    including patient symptoms, medical history, laboratory tests and orders,
                    vaccination history, demographics, and prescriptions, and it was noted whether
                    those data are currently collected or lost.</para>

                <para>Once a standardized general Long COVID diagnostic workflow schematic was
                    developed, the team honed in on the outpatient scenario to capture the patient
                    journey in greater detail. The team chose to focus on an outpatient scenario as
                    there is a larger propensity for data loss when the patient is not under the
                    continuous monitoring of inpatient care. This new BPMN schematic closely
                    examined the parallel paths that a patient in an outpatient setting could follow
                    before arriving at a Long COVID diagnosis to support improved Clinical Decision
                    Support (CDS), patient care, and data collection and usage. This resulted in an
                    approximate current state patient workflow as well as an idealized future state
                    patient workflow with a supplementary data flow schematic. Note that while these
                    scenarios used Long COVID as an inspiration, the underlying principles can be
                    applied to any similar emerging acute, chronic and infectious disease.</para>

                <para>Scenario 1 details an expanded view of the workflow as patients begin their
                    journey to a Long COVID diagnosis through parallel paths. Step 1 demonstrates
                    the different reasons that could prompt a patient to take a COVID-19 test such
                    as notification of exposure from the health department, phone proximity
                    tracking, routine testing at work, prerequisite testing for travel, or feeling
                    symptomatic. The parallel actions are listed for each step of the process in the
                    workflow schematic below in <xref

                    there are several points at which data are produced but not collected and
                    therefore lost.</para>

                <title>Aim 3: Establish the Future State Data Workflow</title>
                <para>Building upon the Future State Outpatient Long COVID Workflow, the team worked
                    with subject matter experts in public health reporting, laboratory data systems,
                    and health informatics to identify points in the patient care workflow where
                    data are captured, where data capture could be improved, and resources or
                    technologies that could support the improved data capture. The team then
                    developed a separate schematic (<xref linkend="IdealizedFuturestatedataLongCovidWorkflow"/>) to showcase an idealized flow of those
                    data; the workflow is framed around an OTC COVID-19 test trigger and showcases
                    how data should be captured, transmitted, stored, and prepared for downstream
                    analytical and secondary use. </para>

                <para>An important consideration when developing this workflow was the inclusion of
                    enablers. Enablers serve to drive the best future state collection and use of
                    the data that are generated in the future state patient care workflow starting
                    with empowering or incentivizing the patient to report OTC test results and
                    stretching to accurate reporting of point of care (POC) orders and results. The
                    team expanded upon what data are collected and where the data are stored,
                    leading to a detailed schematic of how data are aggregated, transmitted, and
                    ultimately used. </para>
                <para>Privacy Preserving Record Linkage (PPRL), a way to maintain patient privacy
                    while collecting protected patient data and preserving data meaning across data
                    sets, was included as an important step between data storage and aggregation and
                    final use by the federal government. [16] Following PPRL, a loop was included in
                    the data aggregation step “Data with Idealized Structure and Fully Defined
                    Terminology” to include an opportunity for feedback and continual improvement of
                    data collection practices and standards. This RWE and analytic-based feedback
                    also informs questionnaire creators as they deploy updated questionnaires back
                    to the original data collectors and serves as an opportunity to implement best
                    practices and suggestions for further exploration. These loops are included to
                    showcase how data insights can provide real-time feedback and identify
                    opportunities for continual process improvements. The future state data workflow
                    concludes with transformed, normalized, and de-identified data in repositories
                    ready for secondary use across a variety of systems depending on content and

                <title>Aim 1: Document a Current State Long COVID Workflow Depicting Data Loss </title>
                <para>The team developed <xref linkend="GeneralizedCurrentStateLongCovidWorkflow"/>, a generalized workflow that outlines a patient’s
                    journey to a Long COVID diagnosis by aggregating common themes, data elements,
                    and components from the information that team members individually collected. In
                    the current state, critical data associated with OTC testing, patient symptoms,
                    symptom progression, and timelines are either lost or sub-optimally reported.
                    Accurate and standardized data reporting at all stages of a patient’s diagnosis
                    is needed to support improved patient care, research, and public health and
                    policy decision making.</para>
                <para><emphasis role="italic">Outpatient Path</emphasis></para>
                <para>A first instance of data loss occurs in the outpatient path when the patient
                    takes the first at-home OTC test; test results, symptoms at time of testing, and
                    timeline are uncaptured. However, lab orders and results are captured during
                    patient testing at the drive-up testing site and results are reported to the
                    “Community COVID-19 Reporting” database. Following the drive-up testing, there
                    is a 60-day window of missed opportunity for critical capture of symptoms and
                    at-home testing results, including timeline and progression data. During this
                    60-day period the patient experiences evolving symptoms and changes in activity
                    levels, routines, and diet. Data are only reported again when the patient visits
                    a primary care provider (PCP) for a follow-up visit, indicating the need for
                    gathering outpatient data generated by the patient. </para>
                <para><emphasis role="italic">Inpatient Path</emphasis></para>
                <para>The inpatient path indicates a better environment for data capture. Similar to
                    the outpatient workflow, initial OTC test results, symptoms, and timeline are
                    not captured as the patient does not report these data. However, the patient
                    enters an inpatient workflow environment where all data generated through the
                    PCP, Lab, and Emergency Room (ER) are documented in the patient’s EHR during a
                    period of continuous monitoring. In this inpatient scenario there is only one
                    point of data loss during a period of 30-days between testing negative and
                    returning for subsequent testing after experiencing continued symptoms. During
                    this period, data regarding activity levels, evolution of symptoms, and change
                    in routine, diet, and vitals are lost. </para>
                <para>The outpatient path eventually leads into the inpatient workflow as both
                    patients’ PCP consider a Long COVID diagnosis. This general workflow highlights
                    data loss in OTC testing or outpatient scenarios, and considerable loss of
                    uncaptured symptom and test results data. </para>

                <title>Aim 2: Establish the Future State of Patient Care</title>
                <para>Once the generalized Long COVID use case was developed, the team explored a
                    more specific scenario that begins with a prompt for a patient to take an OTC
                    COVID-19 test. Current and standardized data points were identified in the
                    representative patient flow and categorized as captured or uncaptured data. The
                    workflow highlighted the major steps over the course of a patient’s Long COVID
                    diagnostic journey, including potential variations in results or outcomes at
                    certain steps.</para>
                <para>The workflow begins with one of five steps that lead to the patient pursuing
                    an at-home, OTC COVID-19 test and exploring home treatment/quarantine decisions
                    without clinical input or EHR data capture. Uncaptured data generated during
                    these steps in the diagnostic journey include exposure methods and related data,
                    symptom diary options, patient background, OTC POC test sales and supply data,
                    results from the OTC POC test, and more. </para>
                <para>Step eight, when the patient looks to confirm the results of their OTC test,
                    is when the process reaches the first point of clinical input as the patient
                    takes one of four potential Lab PCR tests. In the current state, data preceding
                    step eight would be lost or unutilized. Data generated at this step include
                    registration, intake information, continuation of symptoms, lab orders, and
                    results. Standardized data include patient demographics, insurance information,
                    updated lab order information (device and test kit IDs), and EHR standard data
                    elements, depending on the location of the test (e.g., pharmacy, urgent care,
                    PCP, ER). </para>
                <para>The workflow continues with data collection from both POC and OTC sources,
                    aiming to collect as much as possible along the way. It should also be noted
                    that there will be bidirectional data flow within this ideal future state. For
                    example, a physician will have access to patient data collected throughout their
                    journey to support their clinical decision making and, ultimately, diagnosis.
                    Aim 3 explains how data will be transformed and utilized for specific
                    purposes.</para>

                <para>Using the outpatient Long COVID patient care workflow, the specific steps
                    where data are or should be captured were identified and collated into a table.
                    Subject matter experts then identified opportunities for improved data capture
                    through various resources, technologies, and methods. Table 1 is an example of
                    four data capture points from the larger table that identifies specific steps in

                    steps, or components that must be achieved to improve the quality and
                    standardization of data collection steps. The future state data workflow begins
                    with overarching enablers, such as intermediaries and data platforms to support
                    data transmissions, and then dives into more specific requirements for each of
                    the data collection methods like implementing functional barcode/QR code systems
                    on OTC test boxes.</para>

                <para><emphasis role="underline">What Data are Collected</emphasis>: The workflow
                    then explores the type of data that are collected. Depending on the associated

                    methods could capture retail data, test data, patient symptoms, ask at order
                    entry (AOE) questions, and much more.</para>
                <para><emphasis role="underline">Where Data are Stored</emphasis>: Once the type of
                    data that are collected is identified, the workflow outlines the storage systems
                    and databases that originally house the data.</para>
                <para><emphasis role="underline">How Data are Aggregated and Transmitted</emphasis>:
                    After data flow out of the initial data store and through a PPRL, the data will
                    undergo a statement transformation process and terminology representation
                    process that is informed by knowledge management reference implementation and
                    produces data with idealized structure and terminology. These data then continue
                    through Analysis Normal Form (ANF) storage and rules execution and applies
                    transmission standards such as FHIR. Data are then finally ready to be
                    transmitted to other healthcare systems such as research repositories or EHRs.
                    Data with idealized structure and terminology can also follow an alternate path
                    and take part in feedback loops that inform questionnaire development for data
                    acquisition from patients and providers or can be used as real-world evidence to
                    inform improvements to the initial data collection methods.</para>
                <para>While the data workflow uses a COVID-19 test trigger, the purchase of an OTC
                    COVID-19 test, the administration and use of an OTC COVID-19 test, and
                    administration of a confirmatory laboratory PCR test, this process can be
                    expanded to more data collection steps along a Long COVID diagnosis or even
                    expanded to other emerging acute and chronic infectious diseases. This data
                    workflow shows how data will need to move within and between EHRs, laboratory
                    information systems (LIS), federal databases, website and application data
                    stores, and other healthcare related systems and how RWE can be used as a
                    feedback mechanism to support continual process and data collection
                    improvements.</para>

            <para>In today’s healthcare ecosystem and expanding digital and personal health markets,
                large amounts of patient data are generated but uncaptured. This body of work aims
                to highlight some of the gaps in data collection and proposes potential
                opportunities to use existing technologies and resources to improve the quality and
                interoperability of data that are collected from previously uncaptured sources. A
                generalized Long COVID and more granular workflows were developed as a use case to
                highlight specific instances of data loss and opportunities to improve collection of
                data across a variety of emerging acute and chronic infectious diseases that is
                critical to patient care, such as at home test results. Long COVID, a relatively new
                and poorly characterized condition, acts as a use case to demonstrate how capturing
                this additional data would allow providers, researchers, and many others involved in

                interoperability will improve an organization’s ability to ingest data in real-time

            <para>Our analysis of the Long COVID workflow uncovered several sources of RWD where
                extra effort should be made to gather and represent relevant data. RWD, including
                patient reported symptoms, are an opportunity to gather information that could lead
                to earlier identification of diseases. When considering the expanding market for OTC
                testing for many chronic and infectious diseases, it is evident the amount of
                critical data that are lost from the system and unavailable for further analyses.

            <title>Future Considerations for the Emerging Acute and Chronic Infectious Diseases Use
                Case</title>
            <para>The Long COVID data workflow outlines idealized data stemming from a COVID-19 OTC
                test trigger, the purchase and use of a COVID-19 OTC test, and the administration of
                a confirmatory laboratory PCR test. These are all key data collection points in the
                Future State Long COVID patient workflow but do not comprehensively represent how
                data could flow in an idealized state. The team will continue to incorporate the
                remaining data collection steps and data groupings from the patient workflow to
                elucidate how various data storage systems house, transform, and transmit data as
                well as the enablers needed to improve and standardize the associated data
                collection. This continued work will be included in a future iteration of this work.
                While this work currently centers around a Long COVID diagnosis, the themes and
                insights will be used to inform data aggregation and secondary use for other
                emerging acute and chronic infectious diseases that will ultimately provide their
                own feedback and insights to further improve data collection.</para>
            <para>Advanced analytical capability of monitoring and responding to data trends in real
                time goes beyond detecting emerging diseases and can extend to fast tracking device
                and diagnostic tool approvals. Liquid Biopsy (LBx) is a promising new diagnostic
                tool for screening and detecting cancers, however, traditional clinical trials
                require too many resources and cannot evaluate the breadth of emerging LBx assays.
                Aggregated patient data are needed along with timely data from EHRs, LIS, tumor
                registries, and other data repositories for appropriate evaluation. Many different
                RWD elements and classes are required to establish the sensitivity and specificity
                of a LBx, including data on a range of cancer negative/positive patients, lab
                results, pre/post cancer testing, past medical and family histories, medication
                history, environmental exposure, germline sequences, imaging studies, and
                demographics. Further understanding the sources of data can help inform future data
                flows similar to the Long COVID flow to create normalized, interoperable, and
                dynamic data repositories. </para>

    <title>Summary of Findings – RWE Search and Query Methods</title>
    <sect1>
        <title>Real World Evidence (RWE) Introduction</title>
        <para>Search and query methods are used for information retrieval to access unstructured
            data. Most health information is stored in an electronic health record (EHR), and most
            laboratory data are stored in a laboratory information system (LIS). It is important to
            understand how data is stored and retrieved from these sources, and how to aggregate
            this data from different sources. Information systems record and manage clinical
            statements using a variety of standard or ad-hoc models. However, reliable querying and
            information retrieval requires consistency not only at the format level (e.g., Clinical
            Document Architecture (CDA), FHIR, HL7 V2) but also the content model (i.e., the
            information model such as HL7 CIMI model, or Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership
            (OMOP)), and, finally, the semantic and terminology model. There is not only a potential
            for a lack of consistency with representing disparate health data with current data
            models efforts but also further variation in how the data are entered into information
            systems by end-users. These differences pose challenges for how the data are modeled and
            stored, thereby generating implications on data retrieval, data analysis, and accuracy
            of clinical analysis results. For these reasons, the ability to test for equivalence
            across multiple data points is important. A well-defined query that yields accurate
            results in one health system is not guaranteed to be successful in another system
            because of a difference in the underlying data models. If normalization can occur at the
            data level, time and resources can be saved through sharing queries across different
            systems to achieve data fluidity and the ability to build layers of data from different
            sources.</para>
        <para>Organizations like the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), Sentinel,
            Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) and others prove it is
            possible to develop, support and use real-world data (RWD) at “scale” across the U.S.
            and internationally in research, public health, and clinical quality improvement.
            However, the highlighted limitations provide the opportunity to address gaps commonly
            observed across efforts such as data quality and interoperability and access to timely
            data, while replicating the successes. </para>
        <para>A specific, yet generalizable, use case demonstrates the need for real-world evidence
            (RWE) analytics, identify gaps, and form the basis of requirements necessary to
            establish a health data ecosystem capable for widespread collective efforts, public
            health surveillance, research, and care delivery. The long COVID use case describes the
            need to broadly survey and analyze large data sets. Doing so helps identify and define
            poorly understood health conditions for which new and/or existing regulated technologies
            or substances can be evaluated for safety and efficacy. RWD needs to be collected,
            queried, and evaluated to test and validate the “hypothesis” of the regulatory
            exercise.</para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1>
        <title>Long COVID Use Case: Loosely Defined and/or Poorly Understood Scenarios</title>
        <para>Long COVID is a poorly understood sequela to a COVID infection. In general, it is
            characterized by a wide range of ongoing health symptoms lasting weeks or months
            following a COVID infection, including fatigue, post-exertional malaise, fever,
            respiratory symptoms, neurological effects, and more. Even the CDC’s definition notes
            that the symptom list is not comprehensive and that post-COVID conditions may vary in
            symptom type, effect, and timespan, demonstrating how incomplete our medical
            understanding remains. [1] The NIH has stood up the Researching COVID to Enhance
            Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, allocating $1.15 billion to better understand the
            development and symptoms of long COVID. [2] Similarly, the U.K. has invested over £50
            million into long COVID research initiatives. [3] Countless other countries and research
            institutions are doing the same as evidence mounts demonstrating the significant public
            health risk of this largely undefined condition.</para>
        <para>Our incomplete understanding of long COVID is akin to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus
            (HIV) / Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s where
            the differentiation between HIV and AIDS was not yet known. Only after substantial
            research brought the proper discovery and understanding of  HIV infection and AIDS,
            effective treatments and secondary preventative treatments developed. [4] Likewise,
            Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (RD) were once considered syndromic; that is,
            poorly understood and only clinically characterized. After further research, we now
            recognize Alzheimer’s as a biologically diagnosed condition - a definitive diagnosis
            that is determined postmortem only. [5]</para>
        <para>The use of RWD resources has shown promise for hard-to-diagnose conditions. For
            example, Rheumatoid Arthritis related interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) is a difficult
            diagnosis often only diagnosed reliably by rheumatologists in conjunction with
            substantial diagnostic work-up. However, studies at the VA and UNMC PCORnet and VA
            datasets demonstrate that commonly discrete data elements in the EHR can be used to
            identify RA-ILD patients based on their data phenotype. With the addition of low-level,
            basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) for radiology report evaluations, high levels of
            Positive Predictive Value (PPV) identification of RA-ILD patient by data phenotype is
            possible.</para>
        <para>To address the long COVID use case, the FDA must have access to substantial amounts of
            data for patients positively diagnosed for COVID, for patients who exhibit identified
            long COVID symptoms (with and without a positive COVID diagnosis), and patients who have
            had no known COVID infection(s) and do not exhibit long COVID symptoms. These data need
            to be complete and have all appropriate data elements coded with standard values to
            enable meaning to be determined across facilities. Complete, standardized patient data
            across time and facilities will allow researchers to access symptoms, existing
            morbidities, demographics (including weight and age), treatments taken (for COVID or
            other conditions), vaccinations received, screening and diagnostic test data, and
            potentially other information like drug use, alcohol use, and smoking. This will enable
            the use of statistical methods and advanced analytics to quickly determine the relevant
            data elements and values necessary to more accurately establish a clinical definition
            for diagnosing an emerging condition like long COVID, along with identifying risk
            factors for contracting it, and provide evidence to develop tests and drugs for
            confirming and treating the condition. </para>
        <para>In addition to “validated” data, such as existing laboratory and other diagnostic test
            data, provider-level patient reports and physician interpretation data must be
            collected. Furthermore, patient-reported, non-physician translated data should be
            considered, collected, and incorporated with the more clinically oriented data. Existing
            RWD ecosystems could add value to long COVID research. For example, the Sentinel system,
            which collects large quantities of claims records, could assist in identifying patient
            cohorts or determining secondary variables that may indicate long COVID symptoms.
            However, the known limitations of systems like Sentinel must be considered, such as
            potential incompleteness, poor association to actual patient outcomes, or diagnosis
            oversimplification within billing applications. </para>
        <para>There are several conditions that must be considered to effectively address
            misunderstood conditions like long COVID with RWD. Though it may be incomplete, there
            needs to be a baseline description of the condition to identify variables and data
            sources of interest. This definition may be treated as fluid and updated as research
            progresses, so there must be adequate agility to evaluate, collect, and integrate new
            data elements inclusive of existing health care as well as novel observations. As with
            all varied data collections, an emphasis on standardization and normalization is key to
            achieve interoperability. In the capture process, non-discrete data will need to be
            harvested and converted to discrete data. Effective analysis will rely on the ability to
            query the data in multiple ways with multiple parameters, both within and across care
            sites.</para>
        <para>As long COVID continues to grow as a public health priority, a proactive RWD research
            approach could provide valuable insights into the condition that may be difficult to
            discern through other research methods. To effectively understand and treat long COVID
            and other poorly understood diseases, researchers must be able to differentiate case and
            control patients with high reliability to then test the efficacy and safety of new
            diagnostic and treatment options. RWD may have considerable potential in clearly
            identifying patient cohorts to advance understanding of the disease and develop
            effective treatments. </para>
