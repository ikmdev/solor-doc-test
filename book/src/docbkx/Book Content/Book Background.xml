        <title>Systemic Harmonization and Interoperability Enhancement for Laboratory Data (SHIELD)
            Overview</title>
        <para>Systemic Harmonization and Interoperability Enhancement for Laboratory Data (SHIELD)
            is a public-private collaboration that started in 2015 with a singular focus: improving
            the interoperability and utility of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test data. Due to the
            complexity and vastness of this issue, SHIELD has embraced an ecosystem perspective that
            recognizes no single entity has the authority or influence to meaningfully impact the
            state of lab interoperability. SHIELD stakeholders include IVD manufacturers, commercial
            and clinical center laboratories, professional organizations, EHR vendors, Pew
            Charitable Trusts, numerous federal agencies, standards development organizations, and
            patient advocates. SHIELD’s overall objective is to “describe the same test the same way
            anywhere in the healthcare ecosystem” and to accomplish this goal, SHIELD is working to
            develop a solution that focuses on:</para>

            <title>Data Interoperability Overview</title>
            <para>A generalized definition of interoperable health data that supports reliable RWE
            analytics asserts that data recorded and encoded at the time of creation should
            accurately reflect the meaning intended by the health care professional who created the
            data. Interoperability primarily focuses on two aspects, structural and meaning
            interoperability. </para>
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Structural Interoperability</emphasis> – Structural
                    Interoperability focuses on maintaining how systems format data, but it cannot
                    ensure that the receiving system will understand the structured data with the
                    original meaning.</para>

            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Meaning Interoperability</emphasis> – Meaning, or
                    semantic, interoperability works to ensure that the receiving system interprets
                    data in an identical way as the original system.</para>
            </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>In the current ecosystem, it can be a very manual, error-prone, and sometimes
            challenging process to determine if data received from entity A is equivalent to data
            from entity B and if it is interpreted across each setting as the data was originally
            intended at the point of origin. Data interoperability tooling, such as a Knowledge
            Management Platform, that can ingest disparate health data and knowledge sources and
            harmonize them into a common model and change management system could help in ensuring
            that the data are reliably computed and/or transmitted between health information
            systems without any change in meaning. The original meaning, as intended by the first
            entity, and structure should be fully communicated electronically and, upon receipt,
            equally understood by the receiving entity. This type of knowledge platform could serve
            as data interoperability tooling that can determine equivalence between concepts and
            data sets from various organizations. </para>
            <para>To facilitate such tooling, data must be represented by a normal form that can
                safely and reliably support data analysis and be used to aggregate data using a
                standard or non-standard input form or exchange mechanism. Examples of such data
                models include Health Level 7 (HL7) Clinical Information Modeling Initiative (CIMI)
                efforts, including the HL7 Analysis Normal Form (ANF) specification. The model to
                support a Knowledge Management Platform should meet the following evolutionary
                design criteria: </para>

                        normalizing disparate health data can be processed by health IT systems and
                        understood by most healthcare providers without reference to private or
                        inaccessible information.</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Reproducible</emphasis>: Multiple users or systems
                        apply the model and normal form to the same situations and source data with
                        an equivalent result.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Useful</emphasis>: The model is fit-for-purpose—it
                        has practical value for data analysis, in support of clinical decision
                        support, research, and population health that requires information
                        aggregated across health IT systems.</para>

            <para>Normalization of disparate health data and knowledge is defined as "the ability to
            identify every representational format that confers the same meaning as being equivalent
            (i.e., unambiguous representation)." [1] This transformation/normalization would involve
            a data instance to data instance transformation. An example could be John Doe's Systolic
            Blood Pressure measurement taken on June 4, 2019 represented as a Fast Health
            Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Observation instance, which is then transformed to a
            common data model/normal form instance representing this same data. Transformation, in
            this case, is not a simple endeavor that one can hope to implement on clinical data. It
            will likely involve navigating disparate data structure trees and include variable
            representations to then generate a well-formed terminology expression. It is most likely
            possible to target sub-domains for consistent transformation, such as all quantitative
            laboratory results, but in some cases, it may be that each detailed clinical model needs
            its own unique transformation. </para>
            <para>Currently, there are three basic categories of errors that might be associated
                with attempts at normalizing clinical data representation: </para>
            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Errors associated with normalization of content of the terminology </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Errors associated with normalization of the semantics of the terminology
                    </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Errors that result from ambiguous or misleading interactions between the
                        structured clinical input and presentation of compound terminology to
                        clinician end-users </para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
            <para>A number of options exist for expressing transformation logic and for executing
                the transformation on specific instances of clinical data for normalization. These
                range from transformation languages to expensive middleware options commonly used in
                healthcare interfaces. The suitability of a chosen transformation language highly
                depends on the format of the source data, and the quality and accuracy of the
                transformation is left to the transformation author. Examples of transformation
                languages include extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT), FHIR
                Mapping Language, and Query/View/Transformation (QVT). Often referred to as “data
                wrangling”, these transformation processes often require mapping data from one “raw”
                data form into another format with the intent of making it more valuable for
                downstream purposes such as analytics. </para>

        <section>
            <title>Data Liquidity Overview</title>
            <para>To support RWE analytics and data aggregation, there is a desire to “reduce the
                amount of data wrangling” and one-off transformations across the ecosystem and
                instead enable “data liquidity”, or the ability of data to flow throughout the
                health data ecosystem easily and securely so that it is quickly available to
                clinicians, decision makers, laboratories, patients, and others when they need. </para>
            <para>A robust information architecture and scalable solution to enable this ideal state
                requires a common understanding of data and a method to support
                knowledge-representation and assertional and procedural rules based on common
                terminology and statement models. If a shareable architecture were able to be
                implemented across the ecosystem, health data and knowledge could potentially be
                represented in a way that is both applicable at enterprise and project-specific
                levels. </para>
            <para>Another pragmatic methodology would be to engage vendors and incentivize them to
            implement an open, common data model and produce shareable output in interoperable,
            reproducible, and understandable formats that could then be ingested by other systems.
            While major U.S. EHR vendors have independently attempted to create such clinical data
            resources and product offerings, they are often proprietary and do not extend beyond the
            vendor-user community. Further, the data normalization and representation process
            remains a "black box" and cannot be independently verified for semantic correctness,
            data and information loss or gains, or appropriate application of metadata standards.
            [2-3] Despite these weaknesses, an opportunity exists to collaborate with EHR vendors to
            create unique value in their data offerings to the clientele, while ensuring data can be
            safely and reliably aggregated for research, public health, clinical quality improvement
            and regulatory uses as described by SHIELD. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Metadata Overview</title>
            <para>An important construct for enabling RWE analytics, knowledge management, data
                integration, and decision support, is adoption and reproducible encoding of health
                data using biomedical terminologies. Acceleration and development of EHR systems
                have precipitated the emergence of “standard terminologies” and their widespread
                adoption in the health data community. These standard terminologies include
                Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT®), the Logical
                Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC®) and RxNorm. </para>
            <para>While these standards are widely implemented and adopted, aggregation and
            analytics can be difficult because there is no standard representation across these
            terminologies. Traversing the data models of these various terminology standards in an
            integrated way is non-trivial because SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and RxNorm each use different
            formalisms and tools for their representation. Various terminologies have different
            semantics, models, release cycles, and versioning mechanisms. [4] </para>
            <para>Ideally, to support RWE analytics and aggregation, enterprise terminology requires
            an integrated terminology using a common representation (metadata) and management. A
            common terminology model, such as HL7 Standardized Terminology Knowledge Base (also
            known as TermINology Knowledge Architecture [Tinkar]) would allow the following
            analytics on top of aggregated RWE data sets [5]: </para>

            <title>Analytic Environments Overview</title>
            <para>Integrated analytics environments assist in creating and automating data pipelines
            and workflows to deliver actionable information to a wide variety of end users. These
            environments extract data from various data sources, ideally into an integrated
            knowledge base, housed in a central ecosystem – thereby reducing data silos, enhancing
            security and governance, and eliminating system redundancies. RWE Analytic environments
            depend on a variety of knowledge bases and datasets that may have differing fields,
            despite some potential overlap. Proper knowledge management for these disparate soruces
            requires the creation, discovery, and application of knowledge assets to facilitate
            sharing and re-use across the ecosystem. </para>
            <para>Interoperable syntax and semantics between data sources is a critical requirement
            to support effective knowledge management and reliable analytics of disparate RWE
            datasets. Use of industry standards for syntax and semantics helps facilitate
            integration; however, not all implementation considerations are planned for and adopted
            and additional efforts are needed to advance standards to improve data quality. The
            standards themselves update over time and there is a requirement for knowledge
            management in analytics environments to consider how standards and underlying code sets
            have changed over time and relaying these changes to data analysts and users who
            interpret data reports to best understand the information. </para>

    <section>
        <title>Clinical Statement Overview</title>
        <para>A clinical statement is a general informatics term. It is a definite and clear
            representation that a clinically significant fact or situation was observed to exist or
            happened, or that a particular procedure was requested. A clinical statement can be
            expressed as a narrative that provides a written account that can be naturally read by
            humans, as well as a normal form which is a machine-processable representation of the
            statement's data as a standardized and encoded fundamental form. [6]</para>
        <para>Clinical Input Form (CIF) is also a general informatics term. It describes the manner
            by which clinicians author clinical statements and enter them into their organizations’
            EHR. CIFs have an impact as to how information is presented to the clinicians and how
            they enter the data. CIFs might be generated by natural language processing or may use
            models that constrain structured input to allow only certain values to be entered, such
            as a drop-down list or radio button, or breaking up large chunks of related information
            into smaller parts. [6]</para>
        <para>Today, clinical statements are often represented in unpredictable and denormalized
            forms, which makes reliable and safe decision support challenging and reduces the
            quality of other types of data processing. ANF is an approach to clinical statements
            that ensures the statement representation is reproducible and scalable, with the
            adherence to principles of being simple, reproducible, and use case driven, with a clean
            separation between statement concerns and terminology concerns. [6]</para>
        <para>In linguistics, words have their very own definitions, however, if it’s not paired

        <para>The broad goal of the application of standards to electronic health data is
            unambiguous data exchange, or “interoperability” – the ability of two parties, either

            <title>Example of Overlapping and Intersecting Nature of Standards</title>
            <para>Hospitals and independent reference labs are two primary entities in the health
                data ecosystem which share direct relationships and interfaces in the exchange of
                clinical data. Healthcare interfaces must leverage various existing standards for
                    <emphasis role="italic">structure </emphasis>and<emphasis role="italic">
                    meaning</emphasis> and use them together in integrated ways. An electronic
                interface provides an avenue, or connection point, for sharing data in a meaningful,
                coherent way between two disparate systems. Without an interface, two disparate
                systems are unable to communicate in a common language. In the U.S. and elsewhere,
                the most common and accepted messaging structural standard for EHR-to- Reference Lab
                interfacing is the Health Level Seven (HL7) Version 2.x (V2.x) standard. While other
                messaging standards exist and can be used, the HL7 V2.x messaging standard, first
                released in 1987, is used in 95% of U.S. healthcare organizations and in more than
                35 countries. [7] </para>
            <para><xref linkend="ErroneousLoincMapping"/> below shows an example of an HL7 v2
                Observation (OBX) segment from two different mock lab result messages. In this
                scenario, a laboratory has conducted two distinct blood glucose tests on two
                distinct specimen sources. For the first test, a specimen from serum or plasma was
                used. For the second test, the specimen was from whole blood. The figure below
                illustrates how the HL7 v2 <emphasis role="italic">structure</emphasis> standard is
                populated using existing terminology standards for <emphasis role="italic">meaning,
                </emphasis>in this case LOINC®. In the first HL7 segment for test 1, the LOINC® code
                is for a “Glucose [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma”, whereas for test 2, the LOINC®
                code is for a “Glucose [Mass/volume] in Blood”. Different tests were conducted and
                therefore, different LOINC® codes were used in the HL7 v2 messages. </para>
            <figure xml:id="ErroneousLoincMapping">

            <para>While different LOINC® codes were used, the local laboratory information system
                and EHR also define and use their own code systems to encode the tests; these are
                called “local codes." Although not universal, local codes are another way for health
                information systems to represent <emphasis role="italic">meaning</emphasis> for
                clinical concepts.</para>
            <para>The figure shows how one local code, show in blue, can be erroneously mapped to
                two different tests and their distinct LOINC® codes and transmitted in a Lab Result
                message. This mock scenario highlights one example of the myriad of interoperability
                challenges faced in healthcare today. [7] Successful interoperability is dependent
                on either using universal code systems for data capture or through mapping local
                content to a universal code system. Local code systems serve the same function as
                universal coding systems such as SNOMED CT® and LOINC®, however are internal
                identification schemas that consist of a set of local codes and their associated
                definitions. </para>
            <para>Because the receiving system will parse the identical local codes from the two
                mock HL7 v2 segments above, it will interpret the lab result as having been produced
                from identical lab tests. In simpler terms, the receiving system will interpret
                these messages as the same glucose test with a “count of 2 observations” rather than
                two different glucose tests, each with a “count of 1 observation.” Since the source
                specimen and lab tests are different, but represented identically in the data
                transmission, semantic meaning is lost compromising patient safety and accurate
                reporting. The receiving system will interpret these two HL7 v2 segments as meaning
                the “same thing” or representing the “same glucose test”; however, any terminologist
                or laboratory professional would interpret this as “different glucose tests.”</para>
            <para>To improve the quality and safety of patient care, there is a need to refine data
                exchange within the healthcare ecosystem. We often hear comments as, “Why is the
                problem of data exchange in healthcare so difficult? After all, other
                industries—banking, for example— have solved the problem. Healthcare transactions
                can’t be that much more complicated than those managed by a geographically
                distributed, multiple line-of-business banking system.”</para>
            <para>While other industries, like banking, have resolved issues with their transmission
                and exchange of complex banking data across geographical locations and between
                numerous unaffiliated businesses, the complexity with healthcare data arises, in
                part, because neither the standards for structure (i.e., statement model) nor
                standards for meaning (i.e., terminology model) can represent clinical data alone in
                the current data structures. Both types of models can be arbitrarily complex, and,
                at some point, semantics not represented in one must be represented in the other if
                one is to achieve interoperability. [8]</para>

            and Versioning Overview<?oxy_comment_end?></title>
        <para>When dealing with the complexities of the various architectural layers of the below
            informatics architectural separation of concerns, one of the most important things to
            note is that any one of the architectural layers will be undergoing modifications at any
            given point in time, as various Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) go through
            each of their various drafting, balloting, and approval lifecycles. Therefore, it is
            important to establish a foundation for versioning and modularity architecture that
            allows changes and subchanges to be referenced uniquely so that all parties can be on
            the same page as to a particular version.</para>
        <para>In software engineering, modularity refers to the extent to which software may be
            divided into smaller modules and emphasizes separating the functionality of a program
            into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary
            to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality. A module interface expresses
            the elements that are provided and required by the module, and the elements defined in
            the interface are detectable by other modules. Modular programming is closely related to
            object-oriented programming, having the same goal of facilitating construction of large
            software programs and systems by decomposition into smaller pieces (i.e., 'polymorphism
            by encapsulation' or 'composition over inheritance'). With modular programming, concerns
            are separated such that modules perform logically discrete functions, interacting
            through well-defined interfaces. Often modules form a directed acyclic graph (DAG); in
            this case, a cyclic dependency between modules is seen as indicating that these should
            be a single module. In the case where modules do form a DAG they can be arranged as a
            hierarchy, where the lowest-level modules are independent, depending on no other
            modules, and higher-level modules depend on lower-level ones. A particular program or
            library is a top-level module of its own hierarchy, but can in turn be seen as a
            lower-level module of a higher-level program, library, or system.</para>
        <para>For example, the following figure shows how each module could be given a unique
            version number and contain all layers of the architectural stack. In the instance that a
            particular versioned module needs to be extended, an extension module could be added to
            that main versioned module without the need to go to a completely new full module
            version. This arrangement accounts for the constant change in the healthcare
            interoperability space while still allowing two organizations to baseline on the same
            version for testing or exchange purposes.</para>
