    <para>The desiderata for the design of a controlled healthcare terminology was published in 1989
        and expanded in 1998 to contain a list of twelve desiderata which are used to describe
        desirable characteristics of controlled medical terminologies. They are: <orderedlist>

                    formally stated processes for requesting and adding content is required. SNOMED
                    CT®, LOINC® and RxNorm all have processes in place for requesting changes to the
                    terminologies either through the organization that maintains them or through a
                    national release center in the case of SNOMED CT®. While content can be added
                    using these processes, there is usually a delay before a formal addition is
                    available for use. In addition to the processes available through the standards
                    development organizations (SDOs), SNOMED CT® includes additional mechanisms for
                    users to extend the terminology and add missing content locally.</para>

                    Richards' semiotic triangle "shows that, although written or spoken symbols
                    (words) cannot completely capture the essence of a reference (thought) or of a
                    referent (thing), there is a correspondence among them. Either a word or an
                    object can inspire a thought, and people may endeavor to express their thoughts
                    with words or by identifying objects in the world. The relationship between a
                    word and a thing is indirect, however. The link can be completed only when an
                    interpreter (usually a person) processes the word, which invokes a corresponding
                    thought, and then links that thought to a thing in the world (the “referent”).
                    This diagram is seductive in its simplicity."</para>
                <para><quote>By implying a one-to-one relationship between each pair of members in
                        the triangle, this simple diagram masks hidden complexity. Ogden and
                        Richards alluded to this complexity by the dotted line between a symbol and
                        a referent, indicating that the link between a symbol and a referent can
                        only be made indirectly through an interpreter, but the notion that a symbol
                        does—or could—refer to a single thought and that a thought does—or
                        could—refer to a single referent is a fallacy. Thus, it has been
                        historically recognized that multiple terms may refer to the same object or
                        idea, a single term may refer ambiguously to more than one object or idea,
                        and terms may be confusing because they are out of date. It is within this
                        context that we seek solutions to improve our ability to communicate about
                        biomedical concepts.</quote></para>

                    While hierarchical information is paramount, the inclusion of additional
                    definitional knowledge can help maintain and correctly place concepts within the
                    appropriate hierarchy. Allowing computers to use this additional information can
                    aid in properly placing concepts in hierarchies that developers did not
                    originally add to a concept.</para>
                <para>When content modelers add new content to a terminology, the relationships they
                    create are sometimes called stated relationships. These stated relationships
                    help to give concepts a formal definition and can be used to correctly place a
                    concept in new hierarchies the content modeler did not originally assign. In
                    large terminologies, correctly adding all the possible valid hierarchical
                    relationships can be difficult as it requires the content modeler to think of
                    all the possible parents. By adding the additional information, like Finding
                    Site in the example below, additional hierarchical relationships can be inferred.<figure>

                    introduces a "semantic drift" that will cause problems with properly identifying
                    historical data. By assigning meaning to a category or using a less specific
                    concept to represent your intended meaning, information is lost. Rejecting these
