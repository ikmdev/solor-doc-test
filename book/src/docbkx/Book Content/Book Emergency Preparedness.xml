    <title>Emergency Preparedness</title>
    <section>
        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>For the purpose of this chapter, we define emergency disaster response in regards to
            four different categories of disaster: natural disasters, public health crises, acts of
            terrorism and radiation and chemical emergencies. [1] Natural disasters include
            earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, tsunamis, wildfires, volcanic eruptions and
            extreme temperatures, and these events can cause great damage to the environment,
            property, wildlife and human health. [2] Public health crises include epidemics,
            pandemics, and other disease outbreaks ranging from new influenza strains to potentially
            deadly diseases, as seen during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Acts of terrorism can
            range from bomb threats to the threat or usage of biohazardous materials. [3] Lastly,
            radiation and chemical emergencies include the accidental or intentional release of
            radioactive materials or other toxic substances that can cause widespread damage in a
            specified area, as seen in the Chernobyl Accident in 1986 or the Tokyo subway nerve gas
            attack in 1995. [4-5]</para>
        <para>The year 2024 marks 45 years of emergency management for the U.S. Federal Emergency
            Management Agency (FEMA) and celebrates the presence and dedication of public services
            before, during and after an emergency disaster. [6] The rapid development of technology,
            such as individuals’ access to smartphones during 9/11, has greatly motivated the need
            for applying innovative technology solutions during emergency situations. Up to this
            point we have understood the failures and successes of knowledge management in
            healthcare settings, but it’s important to understand them as part of an emergency
            response as well. For instance, communications and knowledge sharing was critically
            lacking during the September 11<superscript>th</superscript> attacks, ultimately
            hampering the emergency response. The 9/11 Commission Report describes the issues with
            interoperability and included recommendations for better communication systems between
            emergency authorities. [7]</para>
        <para>As we have previously discussed, the primary challange with the adoption of new
            technology and standards revolves around adapting technology to the local context and
            need. Addressing user understanding of technology, ensuring interoperability, and
            implementing data standardization - all while respecting current knowledge - are
            critical aspects of this overarching challenge. Integrating communication systems in all
            public and private spheres, and integrating social media and social services requires a
            strong strategy for designing and testing interfaces and interactions for usability.
            Promoting open data and using open-source technology to accommodate as many technical
            solutions is part of emloying IKM. This chapter explores the level of current adoption
            of IKM in the existing emergency natural response system and further discusses
            challenges and recommendations for better practice in the near future. </para>

        <title>Landscape of Emergency Management in the United States</title>
        <para>FEMA was founded in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter, however federal emergency
            management reaches back as far as 1802 when the government needed to respond to the
            natural destruction of a seaport in New Hampshire. Since then, FEMA has undergone
            several organizational transformations and expansion of services to arrive where it is
            today as an agency that helps people pre, during, and post emergency. [8]</para>
        <para>Emergency management and disaster response consists of five mission areas as defined
            by FEMA. These five areas include prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and
            recovery. These areas are part of the National Preparedness Goal which is to “secure and
            resilient nation with the capabilities required across the whole community to prevent,
            protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from the threats and hazards that
            pose the greatest risk” [9], and includes risks such as natural disasters, disease
            pandemics, chemical spills, man-made disasters, and terrorist and cyber-attacks. The
            five mission areas are defined as follows:</para>
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Prevention</emphasis>: Prevent, avoid or stop an

                    and a sustainable economy, as well as the health, social, cultural, historic and
                    environmental fabric of communities affected by a catastrophic incident.

        <para>A simple way to think about emergency management is by breaking down a response into
            before, during, and after the response. In this paper we explore how IKM can play into
            each of these response areas.</para>

        <title>Examples of Knowledge Management in Emergency Response</title>
        <para>Emergency preparedness can broadly be split in pre-emergency, emergency response, and
            post emergency. Knowledge management and communications is critical during all stages of
            preparedness. In the pre-emergency timeframe, during the mitigation and preparedness
            stages of emergency management, knowledge management can be used to bolster training and
            education. For example, FEMA’s Emergency Management Institute (EMI) offers online
            training courses for emergency preparedness through its partnership with affiliated
            centers. [11] Training and education of first responders can help orient and prepare
            those involved once and emergency occurs, and is a core tenet of knowledge management
            best practices. </para>
        <para>Another example of a national approach to emergency knowledge management is FEMA’s
            National Incident Management System (NIMS). NIMS is an example of a system that uses
            knowledge management to integrate resources across organizations by sharing and
            communicating compiled information. NIMS provides standardized vocabulary, systems
            and processes, and are large players when it comes to training and education.
            [12]</para>
        <para>The National Emergency Response Information System (NERIS) is another example of
            system that employs interoperable data and information into an analytics platform
            used by the U.S. Fire Administration to support decision making. [13] Information
            and data from fire departments across the country in integrated into the system, and
            these departments can then access timely and accurate data to provide actionable
            intelligence. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>IKM In Emergency Response</title>
        <para>As discussed, the interoperability of data and communications is already a large part
            of emergency preparedness and response. IKM has a place in emergency preparedness by
            enhancing the ability of organizations to share and integrate critical data.
            Standardizing data can help improve emergency preparedness outcomes and enable the
            government to respond more efficiently, ultimately lessening the damage caused by an
            emergency. However, current standards organizations such as LOINC® and SNOMED CT® do not
            mention emergency preparedness, suggesting the emergency response system as a potential
            area for application of IKM. Furthermore, the lack of organizations that standardize
            emergency response terminology generates an opportunity to build a knowledge management
            and crowdsourcing framework for emergency preparedness. </para>
        <section>
            <title>The COVID-19 Pandemic and IKM</title>
            <para>During the COVID-19 pandemic the absence of interoperable laboratory data was a
                challenge to response efforts. The lack of interoperable data during the pandemic
                showcased the inability of the government to properly estimate disease incidence and
                other metrics, ultimately cascading into inadequate communications and erosion in
                the public’s trust. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act
                (P.L. 116-136) was established to require laboratories to report COVID-19 test
                results to the United States Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary. [14]
                Systemic Harmonization and Interoperability Enhancement for Laboratory Data (SHIELD)
                developed the LOINC® to In vitro Diagnostics (LIVD) mapping specifications for IVDs
                for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic use, and in 2020 HHS ordered the use of LIVD test results
                provided to SHIELD. A study of five medical centers that used LIVD concluded there
                is potential for LIVD to improve semantic interoperability and data quality of LIS
                data. Although the benefit of LIVD is well documented, further efforts to promote
                its widespread use to achieve true laboratory interoperability are desirable.
                [15]</para>
            <para>The pandemic also pushed forward other new technologies to help facilitate the
                response through the introduction and expansion of Artificial intelligence (AI). One of
                the main issues facing emergency responders and the public during the pandemic was the
                inability of policy and communications to efficiently update when new data and
                information was made available. Dealing with inaccurate, unreliable, and incomplete data
                all contributed to a flat emergency response effort. [16,17] Interoperability challenges
                were part of lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, and fostered advacnements in AI
                and advanced analytics.</para>
            <para>AI trains machines to learn from experience, taking new inputs and performing
                human-like tasks in logically programmed sequence with advanced analytics. As a result
                of rapidly developing AI, generative AI, a category of AI system that is able to produce
                meaningful content of its own, is known to be far superior to the traditional role of AI
                that primarily deals with numeric data with a limited amount of text. This generative AI
                has become a powerful tool to leverage existing data for enhancing data analysis and
                decision-making steps. Generative AI can touch on many parts of emergency response and
                preparedness, including optimizing resource allocation, creating alerts based on
                environmental scans, enhancing trainings and educational initiatives. [18]</para>
            <para>Although AI is a powerful tool in the field of Emergency Response &amp; Preparedness,
                the output of AI is solely dependent on the quality of numerical data with limited
                texts. Even with the existence of generative AI and its advanced outputs, public health
                institutions in the U.S. must navigate through a complex web of data paths with limited
                interoperability and data access. For example, more than a third of public health
                agencies were unable to access surveillance data during the COVID-19 pandemic, hampering
                their response. [19] </para>
            <para>IKM can help unlock the full power of AI by ensuring data is of high quality,
                complete, reliable, and interoperable. [20] </para>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <para>Different institutions at the local, state, federal, national and international levels
            navigate through the challenge of adopting the latest technology in all shapes and
            forms. Simultaneously, they not only need to keep up with interoperability of their
            legacy systems with new systems, but also need to maintain an interoperable system with
            other institutions’ Incident Command System (ICS). </para>
        <para>Adopting IKM becomes an additional layer for response organizations to incorporate.
            Having experienced the global pandemic in recent years, the role of compliance is
            imperative for public safety. Enforcement in the areas of public safety and emergency
            planning remain crucial and requires government support to upgrade existing digital
            technologies. Achieving this upgrade at the local and state levels will empower and
            facilitate the federal level of maintaining interoperable ICS system with the latest
            available technology for many years to come. </para>
        <para>The field of emergency response and preparedness is well established with many
            agencies and organizations serving in this space. Emergency preparedness is an important
            part of public health and requires a thorough management plan. In an ideal setting,
            emergency response systems work as well-oiled machines with complex processes and actors
            spanning across every field. The use of IKM in emergency preparedness and response can
            sharpen these processes and facilitate timely decision making and a more successful
            response. </para>
