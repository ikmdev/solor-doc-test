    <title>Application of Terminology Knowledge Layer</title>
    <para>Terminology is used throughout the architectural layers.  In this section we will give
        examples of how terminology should best be used in the various architectural layers.</para>

        <title>Analysis Normal Form (ANF) Terminology Usage</title>
        <para>The Statement Layer requires that the Terminology Expression fields in a statement are
            disjoint: There should be no confusion—or creation of false dichotomies. There should be
            one, and only one, place to put each type of information in a terminology expression.
            For example, the Statement Layer defines a particular place to represent the subject of
            information. Therefore, the terminology layer must not allow the subject of information
            to be redundantly—and possibly contradictory—represented in a topic expression (such as
            would be the case if "maternal history of diabetes" were an allowed topic
            expression).</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">topic:</emphasis> The particulars of how topics—and other
            statement fields—are modeled as a Terminology Knowledge Layer concern, not a Statement
            Layer concern. The Statement Layer requires that the topic represent an Action as a code
            or expression according to the rules of the

            that the rules of the Terminology Knowledge Layer enforce a disjointness between
            different types of terminology expressions. Here we present a starting point for what
            the Terminology Knowledge Layer editorial rules may look like, based on current SNOMED

                <para>SNOMED CT® can accommodate this requirement for simple observations by using
                    Observation procedures to represent the topic (or other types of procedures when
                    appropriate, such as the administration of a medication). In SNOMED CT®
                    examples, the Observation procedure specifies a Has focus attribute linking it
                    to the Clinical Finding or Disorder that it is being observed. The Observation
                    procedure can also be refined further by adding attributes in the terminology
                    model, including Method, Procedure site - Direct, and

            typically some type of therapeutic intent, diagnostic intent, or both. There can be more
            than one therapeutic intent and diagnostic intent and therefore there can be more than
            one purpose. The purpose is represented as a post-coordinated expression, based on two

        <para>The procedure is then refined by post-coordinating with a “363702006 |Has focus
            (attribute)|” attribute and identifying a finding/disorder or procedure concept as the
            value for the attribute.  For example: Request for administration of Ibuprofen 400 mg
