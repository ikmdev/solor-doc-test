     <para>Language is used to describe identified components. While the initial focus of Integrated
        Knowledge Management (IKM) will be to use the English language versions from the
        foundational coding systems, support for other languages will be included as a part of
        future iterations.</para>

            <para>SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and RxNorm as well as other coding systems have various ways
                of representing language. </para>
            <para>Descriptions in SNOMED CT® include one Fully Specified Name and at least one
                synonym for each language. The Preferred and Acceptable Synonyms per language are
                then specified in a Language Reference Set. Any additional synonyms, other than the
                preferred, that are relevant for a language would be identifed as acceptable.</para>

            <title>Dialect</title>
            <para>Merriam-Webster's Dictionary defines a dialect as &quot;a regional variety of
                language distinguished by features of vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation from
                other regional varieties and constituting together with them a single
                language&quot;. Two common differences between dialects deal with spelling variants
                and phrases that have alternate meanings. An example of a spelling variant would be
                &quot;Anesthetic&quot; in the US dialect versus &quot;Anaesthetic&quot; in the
                British dialect. The same word in one dialect can mean have a different meaning in
                another, for example

            <para>The language used to describe a component must be concordant with the underlying
                semantics of the object being identified. Therefore, there needs to be guidelines in
                place to ensure only correct terms are associated with an object in Solor.</para>
            <para>Having a consistent naming convention defined will assist with textual queries to identify duplicates when concepts are primitive and not able to be fully defined using relationships within Solor. Having a consistent way of representing Fully Specified Names will alleviate the issue of users creating duplicate concepts like &quot;Disorder of immune function&quot; and &quot;Immune function disorder&quot;.</para>
            <para>Consistent naming is also important to support effective retrieval. For example,
                the SNOMED CT® concept 386560004 |Glasgow coma score finding (finding)| has 13
                children all with the string Glasgow coma scale instead of Glasgow coma score. </para>
            <para>Another common issue is to add a synonym to a concept that is more specific than
                the concept itself. A concept should only have synonyms that accurately represent a
                concept and not any of its children. If a synonym has a more specific meaning, a new
                concept should be created.</para>

                Requirements</title>
            <para>For a search engine to retrieve meaningful results, it must be able to understand
                common usages of everyday jargon, similar to how synonyms are used to help broaden
                the way to express the same word. This section describes several strategies used to
                help with a query.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Word variants</emphasis> – Similar to synonyms, word
                variants are used to express the same word. While synonyms are explicitly created as
                a term to describe a concept (for example, SNOMED CT®'s "Heart attack" and
                "Myocardial infarction"), word variants are utilized during searching to assist in
                finding the correct concept, rather than explicitly creating the term. Hypothetical
                example - if "kidney failure" is a term created for a concept, a word variant of
                'renal' could be created for 'kidney'. Instead of explicitly creating a separate
                term of "renal failure", this word variant could be utilized during searching to
                find all concepts that have the explicit term of "kidney failure" when a user enters
                "renal failure" by replacing "renal" with "kidney". This would create the burden of
                creating all possible variant terms for a given word.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Misspellings</emphasis> – Certain terms are more commonly
                misspelled when searching over healthcare descriptions. The ability for a search
                mechanism to recognize them and to search over both the correct and incorrect
                spellings will help to identify the correct concept. For example, perineal vs
                peroneal and aphagia vs aphasia. </para>
        	<para><emphasis role="bold">Word order</emphasis> – Terms can be combined in different ways
                to mean the same synonym. The ability to search over a term in varying order of
                phrases is important. For example, Disorder of the eye vs Eye disorder.</para>
        	<para><emphasis role="bold">Components query</emphasis> – The importance of this searching
                strategy comes into play when a certain focus is desired for the search result. For
                example, in LOINC®, there may be circumstances where a certain axis is desired for
                the search. Similarly, a certain hierarchy may be desired when searching in SNOMED
                CT®. For example, "cold" is a synonym of common cold (a disorder) in SNOMED CT®, and
                also exists as "cold sensation quality" (a qualifier value). By allowing users to
                limit the search criteria (disorder vs. qualifier), the most appropriate query
                result will be returned to the user.</para>
        	<para><emphasis role="bold">Active and inactive</emphasis> – Concepts and terms will come
                in and out of use over time. This is often indicated by an active/inactive
                designation. In order to properly return concepts/terms that are active, query
                parameters must contain a parameter to designate if the query result should/should
                not return active and inactive concepts or terms.</para>
        	<para><emphasis role="bold">Regular Expressions</emphasis> - Regular expression or regex is
                a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. This pattern would allow a
                user to retrieve results based on a certain pattern. For example "a|b*" would return
                all "a", "b" and other b's that fits the pattern such as "bb", "bbb", "bab", etc.
                Since the depth and breadth of regular expression is beyond the scope of this
                document, various syntaxes, usage and explanation can be found in many resources
                such as <link xlink:href="https://regexr.com/"/>.</para>
        	<para><emphasis role="bold">Grouping Results by hierarchy</emphasis> - This search
                requirement can be thought of as a complement to "components query". After casting a
                wide net, results could be a bag of various terms (common cold vs. feeling cold)
                that may be cumbersome for users to sift through if it is not organized in an
                orderly fashion. Therefore, if results are placed together in a logical grouping, it
                would assist the user in finding the appropriate query result. For example, in
                SNOMED CT®, it may be worthwhile to group results by hierarchy (disorder vs.
                procedures) to allow a user to look for a result in a desired domain or in RxNorm
                where all Ingredient results are grouped separately from Semantic Clinical Drug
                results.</para>
