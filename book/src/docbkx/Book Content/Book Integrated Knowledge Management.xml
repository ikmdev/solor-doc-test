    <title>IKM Overview</title>
    
        <para>Knowledge management (KM) is an important process organizations use to identify,
        organize, and disseminate information. With the emergence of technologies and advanced
        analytics, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), KM could provide
        even greater value and insights into managed data. Individuals and organizations alike are
        continuously generating data which may sit in siloed databases but, with the appropriate
        tools, can be aggregated across platforms, analyzed, and utilized. However, due to the
        variance in the representation and encoding of healthcare data, data liquidity through
        systems can lead to a myriad of issues including loss of meaning, inability to aggregate
        data, misinterpretation, and more. Integrated knowledge management (IKM) is an approach to
        manage disparate healthcare data using a coordinated and standardized process. Our
        implementation of IKM will use a common model to support the conversion of existing
        terminology standards into a standardized format that maintains meaning, associated
        concepts, semantics, hierarchies, and other critical information and relationships. </para>

        <para>The Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy and Office of the National Coordinator
            for Health Information Technology (ASTP/ONC) currently oversees and promotes SDOs and
            supports the adoption and application of health data standards in the U.S. healthcare
            space to ensure the structure, meaning, and integrity of data is maintained as it is
            exchanged within and between systems. FHIR is an example of a standard that works to
            maintain the structure of data as it flows through systems, while terminology standards
            like SNOMED CT®, RxNorm, and LOINC® work to maintain the meaning of data. While SDOs,
            agencies, and medical terminology standards exist, the way they record, manage, and
            represent terminologies differs, leading to variations in clinical data exchange across
            the ecosystem as organizations use inconsistent and varied concept representation.
            Although there are standardized codes and formats, there are many ways to use these
            standards. </para>
        <para>Our IKM approach employs a common model for data representation to support the
            integration of these disparate standards and improve the quality and interoperability of
            data. One of the goals of this body of work is to develop both a common model and the
            necessary tooling to support the implementation of the common model and IKM
            capabilities. Our aim is to improve patient care and safety through interoperable,
            high-quality data, and accurate transmission within and between healthcare systems.
            Improved data quality will cascade to other refinements within the healthcare ecosystem,
            such as improved research capabilities, identification of real-world data trends, and
            real-time public health information.</para>

        <title>TermINology Knowledge Architecture (Tinkar) Overview</title>
        <para>Today’s healthcare system uses certain information systems to capture and manage
            clinical statements and terminologies. While multiple information systems and
            terminology standards exist, these standards represent and format equivalent concepts,
            semantics, and models in different ways and manage new concept release cycles and
            versioning updates asynchronously. Due to this disparate terminology representation,
            identifying equivalent concepts, transmitting data without losing key details or
            meaning, and ensuring the quality of data is a challenge. Through this body of work, we
            are aiming to improve IKM capabilities and advancing an existing Health Level Seven
            International (HL7) project within the Vocabulary Working Group known as the ‘Guidelines
            for a Standardized Terminology Knowledge base”, also known as TermINology Knowledge
            Architecture (Tinkar). Tinkar is intended to provide an architecture that delivers
            integrated terminology to the healthcare enterprise and its information systems. Tinkar
            addresses the differences in management and structure across reference terminology, and
            with local concepts and code lists/value sets. [5]</para>
        <para>Tinkar is a self-describing and machine processed knowledge architecture that allows
            for effective and scalable querying of data, concepts, and information. Using locally
            defined concepts, Tinkar can integrate various terminology standards into the common
            model by accommodating, managing, and defining granular components and their respective
            data sources to support interoperability of semantics. Having the ability to manage
            complex and individual elements of each standard then allows continual process
            improvement, including rapid extension development. Edits to concepts or newly authored
            concepts in Tinkar can be tested and previewed before deployment to a live environment
            and historic versioning of metadata is perpetually maintained to support iterative
            authoring, development, and versioning. [5]</para>
        <para>Tinkar aims to improve the quality of patient care across the healthcare enterprise by
            creating a cross-cutting and common model that can integrate other terminology standards
            and use a repeatable and standardized process to convert disparate clinical statements
            and terminologies into high-quality, interoperable, and exportable clinical data. The
            four main problems that Tinkar and a common model can address are:</para>
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Suboptimal ability to identify equivalent concepts within and between

                            identification of these findings as equivalent and create a relationship
                            between the concepts.</para>

                            to rapidly develop and version concepts in response to real-time

                facing healthcare systems, but the federal government will also need to develop
                incentives to encourage the private sector to participate and meet the minimum
                requirements needed to support IKM. Due to the inherent complexity and holistic

                and incorporate their feedback, provide extensive information detailing our work,
                the intended goals, and benefits, and collaborate on requirements to support
                improved data quality and patient safety. A detailed stakeholder engagement plan
                that details timelines, stakeholder dependencies, and required actions is required
                to efficiently develop these requirements.</para>

            <title>Stakeholder Incentives</title>
            <para>Federal agencies will need to develop minimum requirements and incentives to
                encourage higher education, private sector, and other stakeholders to participate.
                Meeting the minimum requirements for data collection and data transmission will
                require changes to the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) that standardize
                data entry requirements, representation of data elements, and transmission of data
                on the front and back end of healthcare and laboratory systems. These could be
                extensive changes depending on the age and current data collection of the systems.
                Before hospitals and laboratories commit both financial and personnel resources to
                perform gap assessments, identify areas of improvement, implement changes, train
                staff and users, and sustain updates, regulators and implementers will need to use
                statistical analysis and evidence-based discussions to highlight the current
                problems with data and how these problems directly impact or relate to each
                stakeholder on an individualized level. Demonstrations showing how improvements to
                patient safety, optimization of data collection, transmission, and querying, and the
                IKM environment with statistics analysis will address these current state issues and
                use financial incentives to encourage stakeholders to achieve the optimized future
                state we are working towards.</para>

            <title>Coordination Across Standards</title>
            <para>A defining feature of IKM is working to harmonize various terminology standards
                using a common language to standardize data capture while maintain meaning and
                associated concepts throughout transmission and storage. This requires working with
                a variety of terminology standards that asynchronously represent, update, manage,
                and version concepts. The IKM architecture will require a robust and standardized
                process to track changes across terminology standards and version Tinkar concepts
                appropriately in a repeatable way. Changes will need to be made in real time and
                will need to communicate the intricacies of updates, test the validity and
                functionality of changes, and maintain Status, Time, Author, Module, and Path
                (STAMP) principles. Changes to concepts may occur concurrently as terminology
                standards release updates and will need to be tested and validated using the Tinkar
                authoring environment.</para>
