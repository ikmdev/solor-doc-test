        <title>Preface</title>
        <para>Integrated Knowledge Management (IKM) is “the discipline of bringing all knowledge
            resources into a unified paradigm where the resources all share a common underlying
            representation that integrates version control, configuration management, modularity,
            concept-oriented representation, and standardized viewing, collaborative editing, and
            extension development capabilities within a shared knowledge-management
            environment.”</para>

        <title>Motivation</title>
        <para>In today’s healthcare ecosystem, providers continually rely on data from an increasing
            number of sources to make informed clinical decisions. While this data is a critical
            component of supporting well-informed clinical decision making and the safe delivery of
            care, major challenges exist with the accuracy, interoperability, and quality of data
            that is transmitted within and between healthcare systems. Clinical terminology
            standards are one strategy to standardize data collection and improve the quality of
            patient care with standardized and repeatable guidelines for encoding health data.
            However, these standards often lose critical aspects of the original data capture when
            they are shared with other providers and healthcare systems. To enhance the quality,
            interoperability, and usability of patient data, the health care industry requires a
            solution that harmonizes the different clinical terminology standards and generates a
            common model that supports patient care, data querying and analysis, public health, and
            policy making. Interoperable data in an ideal world would eliminate patient harm and
            other inefficiencies stemming from data misrepresentations and errors. </para>
        <para>The motivation for this work is to explore the pathway to unifying a patient’s care
            experience through reliable and interoperable data that supports accurate and timely
            clinical decision support that is solely prompted and driven by real-world data and
            provides real-time assistance to clinicians.</para>
        <para>The essential challenge of the informatics practice within the healthcare enterprise
            is to quickly deliver a high fidelity and reasoned interpretation of principles and
            facts to the point of care and then rapidly aggregating the point of care information
            for analysis so that new principles and facts can be formulated and validated as part of
            a continuous optimization of healthcare knowledge and delivery. To effectively address
            this challenge, we must focus on the simplification and integration of knowledge assets,
            and on build, test, deploy, and release processes for delivering these assets to the
            points of care and analysis. This focus on perhaps mundane topics is not because we
            think that novelty has no place in our work; rather, that without a focus on aspects of
            our delivery challenge that are often treated as peripheral to the overall problem, we
            cannot achieve reliable, rapid, low-risk knowledge-asset development and delivery in an
            efficient manner.</para>

        <title>Overview of the IKM Book</title>
        <para>The IKM Book serves as an educational resource to allow stakeholders to perform a deep
            dive into the IKM Architecture this team has worked to develop. This Book will act as a
            reference for understanding the complex, multi-layered, and highly interdependent health
            Information Technology (IT) landscape, and a framework for the implementation of a
            layered, architecture-based approach to integrating and managing knowledge in the
            healthcare ecosystem that will seek to solve the previously identified issues. This
            framework, referred to throughout the Book as the 'Knowledge Architecture', is a
            methodology seeking to enable the concept of IKM throughout the healthcare
            ecosystem.</para>
        <para>This Book seeks to have a direct connection to real world events and circumstances
            through examples and illustrations and demonstrate that this approach for managing

            <para>Functional decomposition, also known as Separation of Concerns (SoC), across
                components or sections of our work is a foundational design principle for complex
                system architecture. SoC allows a complete system to be subdivided into distinct
                sections or components with well-defined functionality and dependencies. If
                successful, this approach allows individual sections to be reused, as well as
                designed, implemented, and updated independently to address emerging requirements.
                This is especially useful and important in a medical context given how many
                different health information and clinical terminology projects are ongoing at any
                given time.</para>

        <title>The Knowledge Architecture</title>
        <para>Increased reliance on computerized health records, including EHR Systems, requires
            standardized medical terminology to encode health information consistently across
            systems and enterprises. Clinicians require not only objective quantitative measurements
            (e.g., 90 beats per minute for a patient’s pulse), but also procedural context (e.g.,
            pulse oximetry, manual) about past observations or requests for future interventions.
            While two quantitative measurements may be the same, the procedural information could
            indicate meaningful semantic differences and lead to different clinical interpretation
            and treatment. As information is exchanged across systems, an interoperable solution
            requires a common understanding of data, a method to support knowledge representation,
            and clinical decision rules based on common terminology and statements to ultimately
            address the requirements of medical proffesionals. Current implementations of Health
            Level Seven International (HL7), a variety of global standards for the transfer of
            health data, relies on profiles and templates to disambiguate statement and terminology
            and provide sufficient precision for transactions, documents, and standards-based
            Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Therefore, the architectural approach
            described here is applicable to standards organizations developing interoperability for
            enterprise and project-specific implementations in equal measure.</para>
        <para>The Knowledge Architecture, by definition, is a framework for clinical information
            that is organized into distinct layers such that each higher layer relies upon artifacts
            from the lower layer. The purpose of the Knowledge Architecture is to standardize
            clinical statements and terminologies and eliminate abstract and unnecessary complexity

            but brief descriptions of each can be found below:</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Foundational Architecture</emphasis> – The foundational layer of
            the Knowledge Architecture provides the common elements of interoperability, such as:
            object identity, versioning, modularity, and knowledge representation. It includes (a)
            the foundation and building blocks of the common model; (b) how the repeatable
            transformation process of disparate standards into the common model promotes
            interoperability with other environments; and (c) how the modules of the architecture
            are tightly version controlled over time. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Terminology Knowledge</emphasis> – The terminology knowledge
            layer is responsible for structured sets of medical terms and codes that define concepts
            of interest, including descriptions, dialects, language, and semantic hierarchy. SNOMED
            CT®, LOINC®, and RxNorm are part of this layer. It defines what valid codes or
            expressions may be used by higher level layers.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Statement Model</emphasis> – The statement model layer is
            responsible for defining how data elements are combined to create a statement. This
            layer reuses the artifacts defined in the terminology knowledge layer.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Assertional Knowledge</emphasis> – The assertional knowledge
            layer makes use of the Terminology Knowledge layer concepts to specify non-defining
            facts that may be used by procedural knowledge algorithms. An example fact might be that
            “thiazide diuretics treat hypertension.” Assertional knowledge may also indicate what
            symptoms may be associated with a disorder.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Procedural Knowledge</emphasis> – The procedural knowledge
            layer, also known as imperative knowledge, is the knowledge exercised in the performance
            of some task. An example would be determining a hypertension treatment plan by analyzing
            a combination of a patient’s clinical statements and the available assertional
            knowledge. The procedural knowledge is responsible for information about standard ways
            to carry out specific procedures, as well as other procedural guidelines, (e.g.,
            treatment protocols for diseases and order sets focused on certain patient situations).
            Procedural knowledge, together with assertional knowledge, enables clinical decision
            support, quality measurement, and patient safety. This layer relies on the architectural
            foundation and terminology layers, incorporates the statement model for information
            retrieval, and uses assertional knowledge. Procedural knowledge artifacts may include
            clinical alert rules, reminders, etc., that trigger actions or recommend
            interventions.</para>
        <para>Examining a clinical procedure for controlling hypertension illustrates each of the
            layers of the informatics architectural separation of concerns.</para>
        <para>In the <emphasis role="bold">Terminology Knowledge </emphasis>layer, there may be
            various codes and terms from disparate source terminologies to define a concept (e.g.,
            hypertension). Ideally, these overlapping codes and terms would be oriented to the same
            parent concept during the transformation and integration process at the foundational
            architecture layer.</para>
        <para>The <emphasis role="bold">Statement Model</emphasis> layer enables representation of
            blood pressure measurement values (e.g., systolic blood pressure = 140 mmHg), or the
            categorical data (e.g., pregnancy induced hypertension vs. renal hypertension) within a
            standard data structure to facilitate information exchange or retrieval, such as within
            a standards-based clinical statement (i.e., Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources,
            or FHIR).</para>
        <para>The <emphasis role="bold">Assertional Knowledge </emphasis>layer represents
            non-procedural statements, or facts, such as “Stage 2 high blood pressure is over 140
            systolic or 90 diastolic,” or “beta-blockers and Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
            inhibitors may be used to treat hypertension”, or “beta-blockers are contraindicated in
            patients with a diagnosis of reactive airway disease.”</para>
        <para>Finally, the <emphasis role="bold">Procedural Knowledge </emphasis>layer<emphasis
                role="bold"> </emphasis>provides algorithms to analyze clinical statements about a
            patient, in combination with the assertional knowledge, to recommend a treatment
            protocol for different kinds of hypertension, including the considerations of, (e.g.,
            patient age, co-morbidities etc., which can be generated by an electronic clinical
            decision support system [statement + assertional layers]). This layer adds support for
            workflow and conditional logic (i.e., if-then-else).</para>

        <para>The most commonly known forms of Health IT systems, EHRs, are a systematized
            collection of electronically stored patient and population health information that have
            undoubtedly enabled dramatic advancements in patient care and reduced the burden on
            providers. EHRs have also allowed for breakthrough technologies with advanced analytical
            capabilities (e.g., Machine Learning [ML], Artificial Intelligence [AI]) to more easily
            identify new diseases and develop treatments and reduce the need for patients to
            maintain and carry paper records from provider to provider. </para>
        <para>Despite advancement in technologies like these, a Johns Hopkins study conducted in
            2016 suggested that preventable medical errors, including those due to EHR errors,
            accounted for approximately 250,000 patient deaths every year – making it the
            third-leading cause of death in the United States. [6] When Controlled Risk Insurance
            Company (CRICO), a medical professional liability organization, identified 147 cases of
            patient harm over five years in which an EHR was identified as a contributing factor, a
            staggering 80 percent of these cases involved moderate or severe harm to the patient.
            [7] In total, an estimated $61 million in direct payments and legal expenses resulted
            from these cases, at an average cost of $415,000 per case.</para>
        <para>On the surface, exciting new technology has continued to advance in the healthcare
            ecosystem, but cases of patient harm, redundant testing, and over-expenditure persists.
            This begs the question: <emphasis role="bold">is Health IT truly fulfilling its
                promises?</emphasis></para>

        <title>The Problems with Electronic Health Data</title>
        <para>The advancements in EHRs have had a great impact for patients, but users continue to
            face complications due to the lack of standardized data exchange. Unstandardized data
            stacking has made it difficult to interpret a patient’s chart with accurate data
            reporting. [8] As far as healthcare technology has come, the quality of existing
            technology platforms is limited through the quality of encoded data – which is where the
            problem begins. While healthcare information originates across a variety of disparate
            systems and organizations, the United States healthcare environment requires
            interoperable, coordinated, and accurate information to support high quality patient
            care, clinical and laboratory research, public health monitoring, and regulatory
            decision making. Many needs must be met in the existing, fragmented healthcare setting
            which includes a network of interconnected information systems.</para>
        <para>Historically, the United States healthcare system has been composed of relatively
            autonomous organizations that maintain loose relationships in support of patient care.
            Patients typically visit one or more primary care clinicians and are frequently sent,
            along with orders and patient data, to specialists, laboratories, and other care teams.
            The observation and interpretation of patients’ healthcare data across these settings is
            crucial to the processes of making safe clinical decisions, tracking patient outcomes,
            anticipating future health problems, identifying deviations from expected trends,
            informing preventive and public health measures, supporting clinical research, and
            enabling standardized approaches in treatment and health data exchange. [9] </para>
        <para>For example, when a primary care provider records a diabetes diagnosis in the
            provider's local system, that system must share the data accurately and seamlessly to
            the pertinent pharmacy and laboratory systems. These systems must then in turn
            communicate with one another and with the primary care system to alert the provider that
            the patient has previously been prescribed gentamicin and has recently been given an
            order for a radiologic examination that requires intravenous iodine dye – both of which
            are known to affect kidney function. If this information is not accurately communicated
            across healthcare settings in a way that can be readily accessed, the patient may face
            unnecessary harm or risks that could have been avoided.</para>
        <para>The following sections aim to spell out some of the current problems with electronic
            health data more clearly.</para>
        <section>
            <title>The Need for Unmatched Precision</title>
            <para>The degree to which data must maintain precision in healthcare is unmatched in
                other industries. Health data is unique in its direct association with a person’s
                health outcomes. Nuanced concepts exist in patient care settings creating challenges
                for the representation thereof in data capture and transmission. Laboratory testing
                on a specimen involves a plethora of biological concepts which must be represented
                by data in a meaningful way while maintaining precision as well as consumption for
                other entities or systems in the ecosystem. When an association to a patient’s
                health outcomes is combined with such nuanced concepts, exceptional rigor must be
                taken in the maintenance of data precision and representation.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>The Size, Scale, and Complexity of the System</title>
            <para>The ecosystem of healthcare entities, which share responsibility in the delivery
                of care, is vast. Various stakeholders include government health authorities, EHR
                companies, medical device manufacturers, health insurance companies, medical
                laboratories, hospitals and healthcare systems, and clinical providers among various
                site types. A healthcare entity’s data requirements differ in context from other
                industries regarding the facilitation of patient care and handling of health data in
                methods that are specific to their context. Industries such as transportation and
                logistics are more confined to a common context for the data required to
                successfully facilitate operations. The array of contexts for healthcare entities
                creates an unsolved challenge for interpreting and exchanging data without
                compromising its intended meaning. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>The Significant Variation in Types of Data Needed</title>
            <para>Medical data range in format from narrative and textual data to numerical
                measurements, images, drawings, and more. It is common practice for several
                different observations of a singular patient to be made concurrently, the
                observation of the same patient parameter to be made over the course of several
                points in time, or both. [9] It is also important to keep a record of the
                circumstances under which data are obtained, further adding to the complexity and
                volume of data. Accurately capturing this wide range of data points is challenging
                and can often be done in sub-optimal ways.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>The Lack of Adherence and Enforcement of Standards </title>
            <para>Despite a significant history of emphasis on healthcare data standards, entities
                continue to leverage proprietary, or localized, methods for data representation that
                creates inherent and avoidable challenges in care delivery, reporting, and the
                meaningful application of available technology. Motivations for proprietary or
                localized data methods cannot be confirmed, however, considerations include
                protection of market share from competitors and avoidance of public scrutiny for
                misalignment to standard processes. Maintaining alignment with Standards Development
                Organizations (SDOs) is resource-intensive and invites SDOs to measure and
                scrutinize organizations against the standard processes to which an entity claims
                conformity. </para>
            <para>Current approaches for representing data from various, disparate health
                information systems introduce additional opportunities for inefficiencies,
                redundancies, and inconsistencies. A history of numerous scholarly and practical
                efforts illustrates the challenges of using observational data for safe patient
                care, comparative effectiveness research, and analyses for biases, workflow
                differences, and issues with variations in data collection, such as invalid,
                inconsistent, and missing data. [10 - 25]</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>The Inability to Share Between Systems</title>
            <para>Numerous distinct systems and organizations across the healthcare ecosystem lead
                to a large variation in how data are handled, e.g., data collection, data
                manipulation, data transmission, data storage, and real-world application. Each
                system has a proprietary, standard, or ad-hoc information model and is typically
                configured to satisfy organization-specific needs, resulting in differences in data
                handling within systems. While this variation is not an innate issue, the difficulty
                exchanging data between systems and the lack of interoperability compromises data
                quality and ultimately patient safety. </para>
