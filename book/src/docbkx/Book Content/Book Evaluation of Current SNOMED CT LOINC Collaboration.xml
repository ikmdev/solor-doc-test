     <title>Evaluation of Current SNOMED CT® LOINC® Collaboration</title>
    <section>
        <title> Introduction</title>
        <para>In October 2022, Regenstrief Institute (RII) and SNOMED International, also known as
            International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization (IHTSDO), signed a
            cooperative agreement to collaborate the work between LOINC® and SNOMED CT®. This will
            eliminate duplicative data, allowing the two terminologies to be used together by
            creating an extension of the SNOMED CT® with the LOINC® knowledge standard included.
            Using the SNOMED CT® formats and concepts, the LOINC® knowledge standard will be more
            defined and accessible. [1]</para>
        <para>The SNOMED LOINC® Collaborative Agreement indicates a pivotal progression towards data
            interoperability as the two organizations are industry leaders in health data standards
            and terminology. [2] We conducted an analysis of the current state of the collaboration
            project to better understand the successes and pain points as well as assess how IKM may
            provide additional solutions.</para>

            <title>Knowledge Management: SNOMED LOINC® Collaborative Agreement Demonstration Project
                Progress Reports </title>
            <para>The SNOMED LOINC® Collaborative Agreement is a critical first step forward towards
                data interoperability and a testament towards the collective need for collaborative
                solutions. As described on the website, the LOINC® Ontology can be accessed in two
                ways: through a full data download of the LOINC® Ontology file or viewable through
                the LOINC® Ontology SNOMED CT® Browser. The browser provides the same capabilities
                of the SNOMED CT® browser but provides visibility to LOINC® data through the
                appropriate search or query. The website, while brief, provides additional
                information to the community such as release notes, frequently asked questions, and
                the ability to provide feedback and sign up to receive project updates. [2]</para>
            <para>Regarding Knowledge Management, our analysis will be focused on the systems and
                services provided by the LOINC® and SNOMED CT® Interoperability Solution as
                described on their website. [3] <itemizedlist>

                <title>Hearing from the Community</title>
                <para>The LOINC® and SNOMED CT® Interoperability Solution encourages the community
                    to provide input to help inform how the solution will proceed. [2] Responders
                    can provide their perspective related to content, releases and use case.
                    Additionally, responders can leverage the feedback form to ask questions.</para>

                <para>Community involvement is a key to ensure the solutions that are being made
                    available meet the needs of the users. Similarly, IKM provides the ability for
                    users to provide feedback through GitHub issues. GitHub provides custom form
                    layouts to give users the best experience for submitting technical and
                    non-technical issues or questions. [3]</para>

                <title>Complications in Community Visibility</title>
                <para>Though the LOINC® and SNOMED CT® Interoperability Solution collects community
                    feedback and issues, there is no visibility into that information. Community
                    members have no insight into what ideas and questions have already been
                    submitted. Furthermore, there is no visibility into what feedback will be acted
                    upon or what questions have been answered. According to GitHub, a leader in
                    open-source community best practices, keeping communication public is key so
                    that all members have access to the same information. [2]</para>
                <para>IKM provides the ability for all issues submitted to be visible. The team can
                    provide transparent updates, such as commenting to answer questions, assigning
                    the issue for work, or assigning the issue to a milestone for release. This will
                    allow the issue creator and the rest of the community to have full insight into
                    when the issue may be addressed.</para>

            <title>User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX): SNOMED LOINC® Collaborative Agreement
                Demonstration Project Progress Reports </title>
            <para>Through their collaborative agreement, LOINC® and SNOMED CT® have developed the
                LOINC® Ontology SNOMED CT® Browser, which allows users to navigate concepts, view
                concept details, and determine equivalency between LOINC® and SNOMED CT® concepts.
                [1] This is an important development for the medical terminology field because it
                represents a move toward achieving interoperability. The collaboration data set and
                supporting browser tool, while useful, is a work in progress and has some user
                challenges in its current state.</para>

                <title>Utilizing Search in the LOINC® Ontology SNOMED CT® Browser</title>
                <para>From a user perspective, navigating through the LOINC® Ontology SNOMED CT®
                    browser to locate and view concepts is done in two primary ways: searching by
                    typing or navigating the taxonomy. [1] Using the built-in search engine, the
                    user can find results with as few as three letters. The search results
                    automatically update as the user types, so there is no need to hit “Enter”, just
                    edit the input field and wait for the results to refresh.</para>
                <para>In addition to the search bar, the search option also includes a list of
                    filters to narrow search results as shown on the left side of the image below.
                    Prior to entering text in the search bar, only the four green filter options and
                    the “Group by concept” checkbox appear. After entering text, additional filters
                    appear, which are filtering by: language (e.g., English), semantic tag (e.g.,
                    observable event), module (SNOMED CT® core vs. LOINC® Extension module), and
                    refset (e.g., Web Ontology Language [OWL] axiom reference set). [4]</para>

                <para>The user can also navigate through concepts using the taxonomy structure in
                    the LOINC® Ontology SNOMED CT® Browser. In the default "Perspective”, the
                    taxonomy structure lists all SNOMED CT® observable entity concepts in
                    alphabetical order. If the user changes the “Perspective” to “Comparing
                    Hierarchy”, the system displays a more robust taxonomy of SNOMED CT® concepts,
                    as shown below. The user can then navigate the hierarchy to find concepts. The
                    user cannot currently view and navigate the equivalent LOINC® hierarchy.</para>

                <para>In the current state, the user experience in searching and navigating the
                    LOINC® Ontology SNOMED CT® Browser can be improved by improving the default UI
                    settings, allowing the user to edit the views to fit their needs, and adding the
                    ability to search and navigate within LOINC® data specifically. In the default
                    UI, some features are hidden from the user and may require time and effort to
                    uncover them. Surfacing functional user settings will enhance user
                    experience.</para>
                <para>Noted improvements can be made to search to enhance the function and
                    experience. Improving the search user interface, making search and navigation
                    more intuitive (e.g., filters, taxonomy), and optimizing page space use will
                    enhance the tool’s usability. The image below demonstrates what an optimized
                    search function might look like for an Integrated Knowledge Management tool. The
                    view below is simplified and clean but simultaneously more functional and

                <para>Upon selecting a concept to view within the LOINC® Ontology SNOMED CT®
                    browser, the Concept Details tab on the right side of the screen displays
                    information pertaining to that concept. The initial view is the Summary tab that
                    displays parent/child information within the SNOMED CT® hierarchy as well as
                    LOINC® equivalents (if applicable). The other tabs, Details, Diagram,
                    Expression, Refsets, Members, History, and References provide further
                    information on the concept. [6]</para>

                <para>In addition, there is a settings button in the upper right corner of the

                    preference. This type of customizable functionality is needed for a tool that
                    will be so widely used across fields. [6]</para>

                <para>These features provide the user a functional view of concepts in a
                    straightforward manner, but there stands room for improvement. For example, most
                    tabs of a given concept do not present useful or novel information, if they have
                    information at all. Notably, after searching through dozens of concepts, this
                    team was unable to locate one that had information in the History tab. Because
                    the team was unable to locate a concept with a populated history, it was not
                    clear whether this functionality was not yet available or simply empty. It would
                    benefit the user to communicate more clearly which concepts are missing
                    information. For future implementations, developers of similar tools can look to
                    prioritize communication with the user, so that it is clear to the user what
                    they are seeing (and not seeing). [4]</para>

                <title>Utilizing the LOINC® Ontology SNOMED CT® Browser for Purpose and
                    Contributing</title>
                <para>The LOINC® Ontology SNOMED CT® browser, a collaborative effort between LOINC®
                    and SNOMED CT®, seemingly relies disproportionately on the SNOMED CT® dataset.
                    In fact, finding equivalency between concepts may be best executed if the user
                    already knows the existing LOINC® concept and needs to find the equivalent
                    SNOMED CT® concept. Trials in finding LOINC®-equivalents using SNOMED® concepts
                    often proved fruitless as many SNOMED® concepts did not produce a LOINC®
                    equivalent. Upon finding a concept that has a LOINC® equivalent, the indication
                    is rather small and does not provide a great deal of information, as shown
                    below. [4]</para>

                <para>To enhance the existing system, there should be a more complete record for

                <para>While the current system relies heavily on the SNOMED CT® hierarchy, the
                    system must look ahead to not favor one terminology over another and allow the
                    user to search all terminologies. LOINC® terminologies should have a larger
                    presence within the tool, so that it is easier to navigate concepts and
                    determine equivalence without needing significant background knowledge. [7] </para>
                <para>Using and navigating the LOINC® Ontology SNOMED CT® browser requires the
                    creation of an account. This account, however, does not allow the user to make
                    contributions to the platform, only view data. Editing the tool and terminology
                    requires access to a separate system, which is a barrier to potentially valuable
                    contributions. Specialized tools like this one are better off when they capture
                    the expertise of the individual user through open-source collaboration rather
                    than restricting editing rights. </para>

                <title>Challenges of Integrated Knowledge Communications</title>
                <para>Regenstrief LOINC® and SNOMED International collaborated on a singular virtual
                    location for the LOINC®-SNOMED CT® Ontology Browser to be housed and available
                    to the public. This site has the entirety of their current progress integrating
                    the two data standards up to their most recent version release (October 15,
                    2023). While the site provides some introductory background into the objectives
                    of the partnership between the two organizations, there is little communication
                    of what the overarching goal of that partnership is aimed to accomplish.
                    Integrating knowledge requires an active community effort to advance healthcare
                    information technology, and the challenge of engaging champions for this effort
                    can be mitigated by increasing the community’s understanding and support.
                    Garnering the community’s trust is vital in progressing the efforts towards an
                    integrated knowledge management solution. [2]</para>

                <title>Ensuring End User Adoption</title>
                <para>As communication strategies are developed,  crafting specific messaging for
                    end user segmentations is critical to promoting adoption of tools and IKM
                    advancements. The LOINC®-SNOMED CT® collaboration will benefit from a similar
                    approach in identifying end user groups and then building compelling
                    communications to each grouping based on key interests and pain points. The
                    collaborative partnership’s overall end user adoption strategy will be a duality
                    of technical information that supports the operational collaboration and the
                    non-technical communications positioning that engages users to learn and apply
                    tools. The technical guidance will need to provide detailed support for
                    technical experts to involve themselves effectively within their efforts and may
                    include user guides, collaboration forums, and proper feedback channels. The
                    non-technical communications will need to cater towards conveying benefits of
                    the browser and what problems this collaboration addresses for a given end user
                    segmentation.</para>

            <para>Release notes acknowledge some terms defined by LOINC® Parts require additional
                discussion before finalizing the modeling and terming. An example of this issue is
                LOINC® terms defined by LOINC® Part Antibiotic XXX (‘other antibiotic’). In
                addition, inclusion of the Great Britain (GB) English refset for LOINC® terms is
                still pending. [2]</para>
            <para>LOINC® contains properties that define a Category Status of “Order Only,”
                “Observation Only”, or “Both Order and Observation”. SNOMED CT® hierarchies define
                whether such concepts are an order (Procedure hierarchy) or an observation
                (Observable Entity hierarchy). The SNOMED CT® equivalent of the LOINC® “Both Order
                and Observation” Category Status was not found. [2] </para>
            <para>A goal is for the majority of the concepts created in the LOINC® Extension of
                SNOMED CT® is to be designated as sufficiently defined. Where this is not possible,
                the concept is designated as primitive. Primitive concepts within the SNOMED CT®
                terminology and its extensions interfere with use of a classification process where
                the formally stated definitions of each concept compute the subsumption hierarchies
                and defining properties of each concept. Some of the concepts will remain as
                primitive in future releases and some will change to fully defined as the work
                progresses. Some concepts are currently designated as primitive as a map from the
                needed LOINC® Part to SNOMED CT® concept does not yet exist. However, this is
                expected to be resolved in future releases. [2]</para>
            <para>Across many domains, the meaning of a particular observation can be best
                understood in the context of the set of possible answers (result values). For
                example, qualitative laboratory tests often have fixed answer lists for expected lab
                values, as seen in the screenshot below. Answers are not linked to Observable Entity
                concepts in SNOMED CT®. [5]</para>

        <para>This deliverable serves as an initial report to document the challenges our team faced
            during the research and initial development of an IKM solution and environment. Our
            summary of findings for various components of the SNOMED CT® LOINC® collaborative
            agreement that aims to develop an IKM environment and the identification of functional
            and non-functional issues our team experienced with IKM have identified critical areas
            that will require additional and continued efforts to improve the implementation,
            functionality, and adoption of IKM solutions.</para>
        <para>While this deliverable will inform the direction and focus areas for our future work,
            this report can also function as a resource and reference implementation for SNOMED CT®,
            LOINC®, and other stakeholders working to develop IKM solutions. As our team works to
            develop an open-source environment for IKM, we look forward to and encourage
            collaboration with other stakeholders to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges
            they faced, best practices, and IKM as a whole. </para>
