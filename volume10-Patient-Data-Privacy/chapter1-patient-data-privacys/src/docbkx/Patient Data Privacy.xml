        <title>RWD Introduction</title>
        <para>The following chapters explore real world data (RWD) (data collected from patients)
            and how it’s application in various fields of healthcare can affect patient care. This
            book has presented thus far the current state of data interoperability and how and
            integrated knowledge management environment can enable seamless translation of data from
            one system to the next. This collection of chapters includes aims to shed light on
            topics across the healthcare spectrum from patient data privacy to emergency
            preparedness and how the application of Integrated Knowledge Management (IKM) can
            enhance the use of data in these fields. These topics revolve around the singular goal
            of harnessing the power of real time data to inform decision making. The power of can
            impact decision making, from medical ethics to policy formation, and can enhance patient
            care and quality in the long run. </para>

        <title>Important of Patient Data Privacy</title>
        <para>Patient data privacy refers to patients’ legal protection of their personal health
            information by healthcare providers. All healthcare professionals must protect the
            confidentiality and integrity of patients’ health information, while simultaneously
            providing patients access to their data, including medical histories, test results,
            treatments, and other personal information collected during patient interactions.
            Patient data privacy stems from the branch of medical ethics that focuses on
            doctor-patient confidentiality and is critical for building trust and ensuring patients
            feel confident disclosing important information about their health. As well as having
            access to their data, patients also have the right to correct any errors in their record
            and to allow others to access their health data. These rights are protected both by the
            medical code of ethics and the law, with violations leading to legal penalties. Several
            laws exist in the United States and abroad to advance patient data privacy, including
            the following: </para>

                    Protects the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of health
                    information. HIPAA provides patients with a legal right to access and receive
                    copies of their personal health data upon request and is broken down into
                    Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules [1]:</para>

                            access to protected health information (PHI) in “designated record
                            sets”. These record sets are maintained by the provider and contain all
                            information collected or stored by the healthcare entity, including
                            paper records, data in electronic systems, remote/archived information,
                            or data pertaining to where the PHI originated. It also ensures that
                            patients can access and edit their records if they find an error. [2]

                            encryption, and audit trails are types of security measures that can be
                            built into systems containing PHI. </para>

        <title>Patient Data Privacy and IKM</title>
        <para>Integrated Knowledge Management (IKM) does not handle or store individual patient records, and therefore does not
            directly have authority over the security or dissemination of these records. IKM is a
            contributed knowledge management application that will serve as a quality care driver to
            improve healthcare data quality and support the downstream accuracy of patient
            treatments and public health decisions. The contributed IKM application provides a space
            for healthcare knowledge to be managed in a single centralized area and improves
            clinical support systems to help healthcare providers. While IKM does not directly
            handle or store individual patient records, it plays a vital role in preserving the
            integrity and quality of healthcare data that are transferred within and between systems
            in the healthcare labyrinth. </para>

            <title>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) v. GDPR and Patient
                Data Privacy</title>
            <para>HIPAA is a law designed specifically to protect individuals’ medical information
                while GDPR is a broader regulation that encompasses protection of various types of
                personal data, including health data. However, both laws protect an individual’s
                right to the safe and secure handling of their personal information and are designed
                to protect an individual’s privacy. </para>
            <para>HIPAA rules only apply to covered entities including health care providers, health
                plans, and healthcare clearinghouses. Below are examples of each covered entity

            </orderedlist>
            <para>GDPR rules apply to “Controllers” and “Processors”. Controllers are typically the
                same as HIPAA Covered Entities, and generally <emphasis role="italic"
                    >collect</emphasis> personal information, whereas a Processor is similar to the
                HIPAA business associate and usually <emphasis role="italic">processes</emphasis>
                personal information. Unlike HIPAA, GDPR has extraterritorial reach to locations
                outside of the EU where EU persons personal information is in use. </para>
            <para>Most relevant to IKM is the GDPR rules that extend extraterritorial reach to
                personal data “processors” in the United States when the controller is in the EU,
                and has heightened protections for data concerning health, genetics, or biometrics.
                US healthcare providers can satisfy the GDPR security requirements for electronic
                personal data by complying with the HIPAA Security Rule or by following the security
                framework of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (from which
                the HIPAA Security Rule is based). </para>
            <para>Although IKM does not qualify under HIPAA as a covered entity, nor under GDPR as a
                controller or processor, IKM values patient data privacy and upholds the highest
                security standards. [9]</para>

        <para>Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms® (SNOMED CT®) and Logical

            commitment to data privacy:</para>

            <title>SNOMED CT®</title>
            <para>SNOMED CT®’s statement on data privacy [10]:</para>
            <para>SNOMED CT® itself doesn't directly handle patient data privacy. However, it
                contributes indirectly to patient data privacy by providing a standard language for
                clinical data. SNOMED International Services provides a detailed description of
                Personal Data processed for the purposes of Analytics, Contacting the User, Hosting
                and other uses. The privacy policy also provides details of an individual’s rights
                to their data and how to access and control personal information, and even includes
                a point of contact for questions specifically concerning privacy. </para>

        <section>
            <title>LOINC®</title>
            <para>As LOINC's privacy policy states, LOINC does not collect any personal health
                information. LOINC® is a catalog of measurements that includes laboratory tests and
                clinical measures, that are not limited to vital signs and anthropometric measures,
                and standardized survey instruments. LOINC® also contains codes for the collection
                types for these items, such as panels, forms, and documents. [11]</para>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <para>Patient data privacy is an important aspect of delivering safe and effective
            healthcare and is protected by HIPAA and other laws. The European Union’s General Data
            Privacy regulation ushered in an era of stringent and protective data privacy standards
            and have even influenced new policies, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act
            (CCPA). [12] As we navigate the complexities of data privacy regulations, our team
            remain committed to protecting patient data and patient privacy. Though not directly
            governed by HIPAA or GDPR, we believe patient data privacy should remain at the
            forefront of our operations, reinforcing our commitment to quality healthcare.</para>
