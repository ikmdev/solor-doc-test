        <para>The key capability for a clinician should be <emphasis role="underline"
                linkend="requirement_8">to record and review data quickly and accurately
                (Requirement 8)</emphasis>, taking advantage of up-to-date classifications and
            decision support rules. This should be accomplished by knowing when a change in the
            knowledge base might affect a record. The change management capability that supports
            these operations should be as unobtrusive as possible to patients and care providers,
            and always readily available.</para>
        <para>These operations depend on the availability not only of currently accurate terminology
            assets, but also <emphasis role="underline" linkend="requirement_7">assets from prior
                points in time (Requirement 7)</emphasis>. These may include assets as defined or refined by different
                stakeholders with different sets of assumptions. For
            instance, whether a disorder meets a criterion defined by a standard terminology, a
            payor, a professional society, or a locally chartered board of specialists.</para>
        <para>To support these needs, the Enterprise Terminology that supports the clinical systems
            must <emphasis role="underline" linkend="requirement_9">manage change systematically
                (Requirement 9)</emphasis>, and it must do so for both internally-managed and
            externally-sourced assets. </para>

        <title>Asset Curation Requirements</title>
        <para>Curation of these assets requires detailed change data. The evolution and maturation
            of knowledge happens at different times and places. Keeping standards and relationships
            to standards current is a complex undertaking. A health system may subscribe to dozens
            of standard and commercial terminologies, each of which may publish scheduled updates
            several times a year, and any of which may push out an emergency update at any time. All
            these assets have different designs, so ensuring continued cohesion is expensive and
            time-consuming, and the necessary transformations introduce risk. Systematic management
            of change requires granular representation of the assets and associated asset
            changes.</para>
        <para>There are best-practice capabilities in knowledge asset maintenance. The following is
            proposed for clinical data standards:</para>

                        versions of it are created and saved. </para>

                        its version identifier, time of creation, creating author, and branch of the
                        version control system on which it was created. Further, every version of
                        each object must remain available for retrieval and inspection.</para>

                        to compare two versions of the same object and identify all differences
                        between them. Among other things, this capability is important to determine
                        whether updates to a sub-artifact have changed its semantics in a way that
                        may affect the behavior of one or more of its parent artifacts. Ready
                        comparison is also important when merging two or more concurrent development
                        efforts involving the same knowledge artifacts.</para>

                    <para><emphasis role="underline" linkend="requirement_13">Branching capabilities (Requirement 13)</emphasis>: It must be
                        possible to create a virtual copy of the entire version-control

                        to objects in this branch do not appear in the original configuration. This
                        capability allows individual knowledge engineers to make and test changes to
                        knowledge artifacts without affecting the work of other knowledge engineers
                        or the integrity of knowledge artifacts currently in production. This
                        facility is critical to the orderly and safe management of a clinical
                        decision support system.</para>

                        version-control repository into another branch, such that any conflicts
                        between different versions of the same objects are detected and resolved.
                        This capability is important to enable work done by multiple knowledge
                        engineers concurrently to be combined and incorporated into the main branch
                        of the repository. The merging capability is also important to allow
                        knowledge engineers to update their local branches of the repository with
                        changes that may have been made by others to the main branch, thus ensuring
                        that changes will remain compatible with the latest version of the
                        system.</para>

        <para>Today, clinical systems consume terminologies, but the interfaces are point-to-point.
            To assert or assess new information, the tools must already understand all relevant
            interface models. Since an external organization may modify that model at any time, the
            ability to consume external assets involves ongoing manual efforts to understand or
            confirm the model and the design of transformations to support consumption. This is
            potentially expensive and risky.</para>
        <para>We propose a “data-driven” architecture to support self-describing terminology assets.
            All changes can be programmatically managed with a globally consistent design.
            Management may involve human review, but it can leverage pattern-based recognition of
            specific change types for automated handling, leaving a smaller number of cases that
            require human judgment. This information design will support a common representation of
            all terminologies. There are two key requirements for this design:</para>
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="underline" linkend="requirement_11">A complete record of all changes, including relevant change context information (Requirement 11)</emphasis></para>

            </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>The context information of the first requirement includes the following:</para>
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>The <emphasis role="underline" linkend="requirement_19">Status</emphasis> of
                    the asset: whether it should be considered active or inactive in the context of

                        >(Requirement 19)</emphasis>. For systems that do not support status, the

                    that do not provide an author, a default author will be created for the

            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>The domain or organizational name of the larger asset within which the

        </orderedlist>
        <para>These elements together are referred to by the acronym “<emphasis role="bold"
                >STAMP</emphasis>.” Every new assertion, whether a new asset or a change to an
            existing asset, must have a STAMP to determine when it is to be used. The STAMP
            properties support the ability to apply terminology assets for specific purposes. For
            example:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>“Path” can be used to test provisional content without physically swapping out
                    systems. </para>

            <listitem>
                <para>“Modules” are used to organize content for maintenance and publication
                    purposes. Modules are the domain or organizational name of the larger asset
                    within which the component is meaningful, such as code system or edition.
                    Modularity for terminologies should follow a similar design to modularity in
                    software engineering. Deciding what belongs in certain modules or extensions
                    within certain terminologies is a difficult subject that is out of scope for
                    this document, but having support for the ability to create modules, recognize
                    redundancy, and merge or retire concepts are important requirements that must be
                    supported. [12-14] </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>“Time” supports the ability to apply CDS rules as they would have looked in
                    the past.</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>A further requirement is that not only must the architecture support these properties,
            but that <emphasis role="underline">it must require</emphasis> the properties for all
            assets under curation. Without consistent application of this rule, the foundational
            capability of detailed version management is more difficult. </para>
        <para>Additionally, for an asset to support a record of changes, each <emphasis
                role="underline" linkend="requirement_10">asset must itself be identifiable
                (Requirement 10)</emphasis>.</para>
        <para>The “single syntax” requirement is harder to satisfy. One approach would be to define
            a syntax that addresses the data elements of all known terminologies. This would be a
            heavy specification, that would be difficult to maintain, and could fail to capture new
            elements as terminologies are added in the future.</para>
        <para>The other approach is to use a “self-describing” or “meta-modeling” approach, where
            the syntax defines not only the content but also what the content means. “Rigid” or
            “brittle” specifications determine in advance where information belongs: a database may
            use column names to suggest what belongs in a column, but there is no way to determine
            whether the name is a good one, or whether an instance value meets the criterion implied
            by the name. But flexible specifications support data definition. Extensible Markup
            Language (XML) (a subset of Standard Generalized Markup Language [SGML]) provides a way
            to specify types of data and structural (not semantic) relationships. Resource
            Description Framework (RDF) goes one step further by making the relationship between an
            element and its containing class an explicit part of every triplet. If this relationship
            is specified in a controlled terminology, then assertions can be tested for validity.
            For example, if an RDF Schema Specification (RDFS) asserts that the finding site of a
            lesion must be an anatomical feature, then assertions about actual lesions can be tested
            for valid finding sites. Furthermore, this logic specifies a “range” in the same
            syntactic structure as the instance assertion: changes to the knowledge base do not
            affect the syntactical representation of the knowledge. Systems that adopt this approach
            will require effort to take advantage of new features of terminologies, without having
            to rebuild their infrastructure when changes are made.</para>
        <para>Having change data in discrete tagged change sets will allow the software to hide most
            of the complexity of version management from the human managers, allowing them to focus
            on significant decisions.</para>

        <title>Configuration Requirements</title>
        <para>A granular self-describing model will support any statement that can be made using
            concepts in a subject-predicate-object structure, and its compositional aspect permits
            compound predicates. It is difficult to imagine a proposition that cannot be supported,
            however, this means that there are multiple ways to support any specific kind of
            statement that a terminology knowledge base must support. This section addresses best
            practices for these cases.</para>

            <title>Operations</title>
            <para><emphasis role="underline">Import</emphasis>: A user may identify content from
                another system and write it into the Terminology Repository. When this happens, the
                new content will be recorded in the common, self-describing format. When a set of
                content is imported, rules asserted by the source steward or the Terminology
                Repository steward may be used to assert structural equivalence in the repository
                (i.e., different source concepts may be represented as alternate representations of
                the same root concept). During importation of subsequent versions of a system,
                changes to assets on which other enterprise assets depend must be identified and
                managed as directed by documented policies. The import operation will usually
                identify sets of such changes which require prioritization to prevent redundant
                processing.</para>

                 </orderedlist>
                <para>For example, constraints would be used to represent standard terminology

                    <para>Constraints can be applied (or not applied) based on various criteria to

                    <para>Since some Quality Assurance Constraints do not always indicate an error,
                an Allow List could also be represented as a Semantic to record concepts that are
                allowed to not conform to a constraint. Constraints would be represented using
                semantics as they are self describing and can support multiple different
                representations for constraints (SNOMED CT® Expression Constraint Language, Drools,
                etc.). Representing Constraints as a Semantic also ensures STAMP. STAMP is versioned
                over time, capturing author information and allowing for tests and progress over
                different modules and paths.</para>
                    <para>Implementing Constraints would depend upon how the Constraints are written
                and formatted. For example, implementers could utilize a Rete algorithm through
                something like Drools to implement Constraints.</para>
